Canto

I
"My uncle's goodness is extreme,\nIf seriously he hath disease;\nHe hath acquired the world's esteem\nAnd nothing more important sees;\nA paragon of virtue he!\nBut what a nuisance it will be,\nChained to his bedside night and day\nWithout a chance to slip away.\nYe need dissimulation base\nA dying man with art to soothe,\nBeneath his head the pillow smooth,\nAnd physic bring with mournful face,\nTo sigh and meditate alone:\nWhen will the devil take his own!”

II
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove\nThrough clouds of dust at postal pace,\nBy the decree of Mighty Jove,\nInheritor of all his race.\nFriends of Liudmila and Ruslan,\nLet me present ye to the man,\nWho without more prevarication\nThe hero is of my narration!\nOnegin, O my gentle readers,\nWas born beside the Neva, where\nIt may be ye were born, or there\nHave shone as one of fashion's leaders.\nI also wandered there of old,\nBut cannot stand the northern cold.

III
Having performed his service truly,\nDeep into debt his father ran;\nThree balls a year he gave ye duly,\nAt last became a ruined man.\nBut Eugene was by fate preserved,\nFor first "madame” his wants observed,\nAnd then "monsieur” supplied her place;\nThe boy was wild but full of grace.\n"Monsieur l'Abbe,” a starving Gaul,\nFearing his pupil to annoy,\nInstructed jestingly the boy,\nMorality taught scarce at all;\nGently for pranks he would reprove\nAnd in the Summer Garden rove.

IV
When youth's rebellious hour drew near\nAnd my Eugene the path must trace – \nThe path of hope and tender fear – \nMonsieur clean out of doors they chase.\nLo! my Onegin free as air,\nCropped in the latest style his hair,\nDressed like a London dandy he\nThe giddy world at last shall see.\nHe wrote and spoke, so all allowed,\nIn the French language perfectly,\nDanced the mazurka gracefully,\nWithout the least constraint he bowed.\nWhat more's required? The world replies,\nHe is a charming youth and wise.

V
We all of us of education\nA something somehow have obtained,\nThus, praised be God! a reputation\nWith us is easily attained.\nOnegin was – so many deemed\n(Unerring critics self-esteemed),\nPedantic although scholar like,\nIn truth he had the happy trick\nWithout constraint in conversation\nOf touching lightly every theme.\nSilent, oracular ye'd see him\nAmid a serious disputation,\nThen suddenly discharge a joke\nThe ladies' laughter to provoke.

VI
Latin is just now not in vogue,\nBut if the truth I must relate,\nOnegin knew enough, the rogue\nA mild quotation to translate,\nA little Juvenal to spout,\nWith "vale” finish off a note;\nTwo verses he could recollect\nOf the Aeneid, but incorrect.\nIn history he took no pleasure,\nThe dusty chronicles of earth\nFor him were but of little worth,\nYet still of anecdotes a treasure\nWithin his memory there lay,\nFrom Romulus unto our day.

VII
For empty sound the rascal swore he\nExistence would not make a curse,\nKnew not an iamb from a choree,\nAlthough we read him heaps of verse.\nHomer, Theocritus, he jeered,\nBut Adam Smith to read appeared,\nAnd at economy was great;\nThat is, he could elucidate\nHow empires store of wealth unfold,\nHow flourish, why and wherefore less\nIf the raw product they possess\nThe medium is required of gold.\nThe father scarcely understands\nHis son and mortgages his lands.

VIII
But upon all that Eugene knew\nI have no leisure here to dwell,\nBut say he was a genius who\nIn one thing really did excel.\nIt occupied him from a boy,\nA labour, torment, yet a joy,\nIt whiled his idle hours away\nAnd wholly occupied his day – \nThe amatory science warm,\nWhich Ovid once immortalized,\nFor which the poet agonized\nLaid down his life of sun and storm\nOn the steppes of Moldavia lone,\nFar from his Italy – his own.

IX
How soon he learnt deception's art,\nHope to conceal and jealousy,\nFalse confidence or doubt to impart,\nSombre or glad in turn to be,\nHaughty appear, subservient,\nObsequious or indifferent!\nWhat languor would his silence show,\nHow full of fire his speech would glow!\nHow artless was the note which spoke\nOf love again, and yet again;\nHow deftly could he transport feign!\nHow bright and tender was his look,\nModest yet daring! And a tear\nWould at the proper time appear.

X
How well he played the greenhorn's part\nTo cheat the inexperienced fair,\nSometimes by pleasing flattery's art,\nSometimes by ready-made despair;\nThe feeble moment would espy\nOf tender years the modesty\nConquer by passion and address,\nAwait the long-delayed caress.\nAvowal then 'twas time to pray,\nAttentive to the heart's first beating,\nFollow up love – a secret meeting\nArrange without the least delay – \nThen, then – well, in some solitude\nLessons to give he understood!

XI
How soon he learnt to titillate\nThe heart of the inveterate flirt!\nDesirous to annihilate\nHis own antagonists expert,\nHow bitterly he would malign,\nWith many a snare their pathway line!\nBut ye, O happy husbands, ye\nWith him were friends eternally:\nThe crafty spouse caressed him, who\nBy Faublas in his youth was schooled,\nAnd the suspicious veteran old,\nThe pompous, swaggering cuckold too,\nWho floats contentedly through life,\nProud of his dinners and his wife!

XII
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,\nHis valet brings him letters three.\nWhat, invitations? The same day\nAs many entertainments be!\nA ball here, there a children's treat,\nWhither shall my rapscallion flit?\nWhither shall he go first? He'll see,\nPerchance he will to all the three.\nMeantime in matutinal dress\nAnd hat surnamed a "Bolivar”\nHe hies unto the "Boulevard,”\nTo loiter there in idleness\nUntil the sleepless Breguet chime\nAnnouncing to him dinner-time.

XIII
'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,\n"Drive on!” the cheerful cry goes forth,\nHis furs are powdered on the way\nBy the fine silver of the north.\nHe bends his course to Talon's, where\nHe knows Kaverine will repair.\nHe enters. High the cork arose\nAnd Comet champagne foaming flows.\nBefore him red roast beef is seen\nAnd truffles, dear to youthful eyes,\nFlanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,\nThe choicest flowers of French cuisine,\nAnd Limburg cheese alive and old\nIs seen next pine-apples of gold.

XIV
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels\nTo cool the cutlets' seething grease,\nWhen the sonorous Breguet tells\nOf the commencement of the piece.\nA critic of the stage malicious,\nA slave of actresses capricious,\nOnegin was a citizen\nOf the domains of the side-scene.\nTo the theatre he repairs\nWhere each young critic ready stands,\nCapers applauds with clap of hands,\nWith hisses Cleopatra scares,\nMoina recalls for this alone\nThat all may hear his voice's tone.

XV
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly\nShone pungent Satire's dauntless king,\nVon Wisine, friend of liberty,\nAnd Kniajnine, apt at copying.\nThe young Simeonova too there\nWith Ozeroff was wont to share\nApplause, the people's donative.\nThere our Katenine did revive\nCorneille's majestic genius,\nSarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out\nHis comedies, a noisy rout,\nThere Didelot became glorious,\nThere, there, beneath the side-scene's shade\nThe drama of my youth was played.

XVI
My goddesses, where are your shades?\nDo ye not hear my mournful sighs?\nAre ye replaced by other maids\nWho cannot conjure former joys?\nShall I your chorus hear anew,\nRussia's Terpsichore review\nAgain in her ethereal dance?\nOr will my melancholy glance\nOn the dull stage find all things changed,\nThe disenchanted glass direct\nWhere I can no more recollect? – \nA careless looker-on estranged\nIn silence shall I sit and yawn\nAnd dream of life's delightful dawn?

XVII
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps\nOn pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,\nImpatiently the gallery stamps,\nThe curtain now they slowly raise.\nObedient to the magic strings,\nBrilliant, ethereal, there springs\nForth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding\nIstomina the nimbly-bounding;\nWith one foot resting on its tip\nSlow circling round its fellow swings\nAnd now she skips and now she springs\nLike down from Aeolus's lip,\nNow her lithe form she arches o'er\nAnd beats with rapid foot the floor.

XVIII
Shouts of applause! Onegin passes\nBetween the stalls, along the toes;\nSeated, a curious look with glasses\nOn unknown female forms he throws.\nFree scope he yields unto his glance,\nReviews both dress and countenance,\nWith all dissatisfaction shows.\nTo male acquaintances he bows,\nAnd finally he deigns let fall\nUpon the stage his weary glance.\nHe yawns, averts his countenance,\nExclaiming, "We must change 'em all!\nI long by ballets have been bored,\nNow Didelot scarce can be endured!”

XIX
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout\nAcross the stage still madly sweep,\nWhilst the tired serving-men without\nWrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.\nStill the loud stamping doth not cease,\nStill they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,\nStill everywhere, without, within,\nThe lamps illuminating shine;\nThe steed benumbed still pawing stands\nAnd of the irksome harness tires,\nAnd still the coachmen round the fires\nAbuse their masters, rub their hands:\nBut Eugene long hath left the press\nTo array himself in evening dress.

XX
Faithfully shall I now depict,\nPortray the solitary den\nWherein the child of fashion strict\nDressed him, undressed, and dressed again?\nAll that industrial London brings\nFor tallow, wood and other things\nAcross the Baltic's salt sea waves,\nAll which caprice and affluence craves,\nAll which in Paris eager taste,\nChoosing a profitable trade,\nFor our amusement ever made\nAnd ease and fashionable waste, – \nAdorned the apartment of Eugene,\nPhilosopher just turned eighteen.

XXI
China and bronze the tables weight,\nAmber on pipes from Stamboul glows,\nAnd, joy of souls effeminate,\nPhials of crystal scents enclose.\nCombs of all sizes, files of steel,\nScissors both straight and curved as well,\nOf thirty different sorts, lo! brushes\nBoth for the nails and for the tushes.\nRousseau, I would remark in passing,\nCould not conceive how serious Grimm\nDared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,\nEloquent raver all-surpassing, – \nThe friend of liberty and laws\nIn this case quite mistaken was.

XXII
The most industrious man alive\nMay yet be studious of his nails;\nWhat boots it with the age to strive?\nCustom the despot soon prevails.\nA new Kaverine Eugene mine,\nDreading the world's remarks malign,\nWas that which we are wont to call\nA fop, in dress pedantical.\nThree mortal hours per diem he\nWould loiter by the looking-glass,\nAnd from his dressing-room would pass\nLike Venus when, capriciously,\nThe goddess would a masquerade\nAttend in male attire arrayed.

XXIII
On this artistical retreat\nHaving once fixed your interest,\nI might to connoisseurs repeat\nThe style in which my hero dressed;\nThough I confess I hardly dare\nDescribe in detail the affair,\nSince words like pantaloons, vest, coat,\nTo Russ indigenous are not;\nAnd also that my feeble verse – \nPardon I ask for such a sin – \nWith words of foreign origin\nToo much I'm given to intersperse,\nThough to the Academy I come\nAnd oft its Dictionary thumb.

XXIV
But such is not my project now,\nSo let us to the ball-room haste,\nWhither at headlong speed doth go\nEugene in hackney carriage placed.\nPast darkened windows and long streets\nOf slumbering citizens he fleets,\nTill carriage lamps, a double row,\nCast a gay lustre on the snow,\nWhich shines with iridescent hues.\nHe nears a spacious mansion's gate,\nBy many a lamp illuminate,\nAnd through the lofty windows views\nProfiles of lovely dames he knows\nAnd also fashionable beaux.

XXV
Our hero stops and doth alight,\nFlies past the porter to the stair,\nBut, ere he mounts the marble flight,\nWith hurried hand smooths down his hair.\nHe enters: in the hall a crowd,\nNo more the music thunders loud,\nSome a mazurka occupies,\nCrushing and a confusing noise;\nSpurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,\nThe feet of graceful ladies fly,\nAnd following them ye might espy\nFull many a glance like lightning flash,\nAnd by the fiddle's rushing sound\nThe voice of jealousy is drowned.

XXVI
In my young days of wild delight\nOn balls I madly used to dote,\nFond declarations they invite\nOr the delivery of a note.\nSo hearken, every worthy spouse,\nI would your vigilance arouse,\nAttentive be unto my rhymes\nAnd due precautions take betimes.\nYe mothers also, caution use,\nUpon your daughters keep an eye,\nEmploy your glasses constantly,\nFor otherwise – God only knows!\nI lift a warning voice because\nI long have ceased to offend the laws.

XXVII
Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly\nI've wasted in amusements vain,\nBut were it not immoral I\nShould dearly like a dance again.\nI love its furious delight,\nThe crowd and merriment and light,\nThe ladies, their fantastic dress,\nAlso their feet – yet ne'ertheless\nScarcely in Russia can ye find\nThree pairs of handsome female feet;\nAh! I still struggle to forget\nA pair; though desolate my mind,\nTheir memory lingers still and seems\nTo agitate me in my dreams.

XXVIII
When, where, and in what desert land,\nMadman, wilt thou from memory raze\nThose feet? Alas! on what far strand\nDo ye of spring the blossoms graze?\nLapped in your Eastern luxury,\nNo trace ye left in passing by\nUpon the dreary northern snows,\nBut better loved the soft repose\nOf splendid carpets richly wrought.\nI once forgot for your sweet cause\nThe thirst for fame and man's applause,\nMy country and an exile's lot;\nMy joy in youth was fleeting e'en\nAs your light footprints on the green.

XXIX
Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,\nAre admirable, my dear friend,\nBut yet Terpsichore bespeaks\nCharms more enduring in the end.\nFor promises her feet reveal\nOf untold gain she must conceal,\nTheir privileged allurements fire\nA hidden train of wild desire.\nI love them, O my dear Elvine,\nBeneath the table-cloth of white,\nIn winter on the fender bright,\nIn springtime on the meadows green,\nUpon the ball-room's glassy floor\nOr by the ocean's rocky shore.

XXX
Beside the stormy sea one day\nI envied sore the billows tall,\nWhich rushed in eager dense array\nEnamoured at her feet to fall.\nHow like the billow I desired\nTo kiss the feet which I admired!\nNo, never in the early blaze\nOf fiery youth's untutored days\nSo ardently did I desire\nA young Armida's lips to press,\nHer cheek of rosy loveliness\nOr bosom full of languid fire, – \nA gust of passion never tore\nMy spirit with such pangs before.

XXXI
Another time, so willed it Fate,\nImmersed in secret thought I stand\nAnd grasp a stirrup fortunate – \nHer foot was in my other hand.\nAgain imagination blazed,\nThe contact of the foot I raised\nRekindled in my withered heart\nThe fires of passion and its smart – \nAway! and cease to ring their praise\nFor ever with thy tattling lyre,\nThe proud ones are not worth the fire\nOf passion they so often raise.\nThe words and looks of charmers sweet\nAre oft deceptive – like their feet.

XXXII
Where is Onegin? Half asleep,\nStraight from the ball to bed he goes,\nWhilst Petersburg from slumber deep\nThe drum already doth arouse.\nThe shopman and the pedlar rise\nAnd to the Bourse the cabman plies;\nThe Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,\nCrunching the morning snow she treads;\nMorning awakes with joyous sound;\nThe shutters open; to the skies\nIn column blue the smoke doth rise;\nThe German baker looks around\nHis shop, a night-cap on his head,\nAnd pauses oft to serve out bread.

XXXIII
But turning morning into night,\nTired by the ball's incessant noise,\nThe votary of vain delight\nSleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,\nLate in the afternoon to rise,\nWhen the same life before him lies\nTill morn – life uniform but gay,\nTo-morrow just like yesterday.\nBut was our friend Eugene content,\nFree, in the blossom of his spring,\nAmidst successes flattering\nAnd pleasure's daily blandishment,\nOr vainly 'mid luxurious fare\nWas he in health and void of care? –

XXXIV
Even so! His passions soon abated,\nHateful the hollow world became,\nNor long his mind was agitated\nBy love's inevitable flame.\nFor treachery had done its worst;\nFriendship and friends he likewise curst,\nBecause he could not gourmandise\nDaily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies\nAnd irrigate them with champagne;\nNor slander viciously could spread\nWhene'er he had an aching head;\nAnd, though a plucky scatterbrain,\nHe finally lost all delight\nIn bullets, sabres, and in fight.

XXXV
His malady, whose cause I ween\nIt now to investigate is time,\nWas nothing but the British spleen\nTransported to our Russian clime.\nIt gradually possessed his mind;\nThough, God be praised! he ne'er designed\nTo slay himself with blade or ball,\nIndifferent he became to all,\nAnd like Childe Harold gloomily\nHe to the festival repairs,\nNor boston nor the world's affairs\nNor tender glance nor amorous sigh\nImpressed him in the least degree, – \nCallous to all he seemed to be.

XXXVI
Ye miracles of courtly grace,\nHe left you first, and I must own\nThe manners of the highest class\nHave latterly vexatious grown;\nAnd though perchance a lady may\nDiscourse of Bentham or of Say,\nYet as a rule their talk I call\nHarmless, but quite nonsensical.\nThen they're so innocent of vice,\nSo full of piety, correct,\nSo prudent, and so circumspect\nStately, devoid of prejudice,\nSo inaccessible to men,\nTheir looks alone produce the spleen.

XXXVII
And you, my youthful damsels fair,\nWhom latterly one often meets\nUrging your droshkies swift as air\nAlong Saint Petersburg's paved streets,\nFrom you too Eugene took to flight,\nAbandoning insane delight,\nAnd isolated from all men,\nYawning betook him to a pen.\nHe thought to write, but labour long\nInspired him with disgust and so\nNought from his pen did ever flow,\nAnd thus he never fell among\nThat vicious set whom I don't blame – \nBecause a member I became.

XXXVIII
Once more to idleness consigned,\nHe felt the laudable desire\nFrom mere vacuity of mind\nThe wit of others to acquire.\nA case of books he doth obtain – \nHe reads at random, reads in vain.\nThis nonsense, that dishonest seems,\nThis wicked, that absurd he deems,\nAll are constrained and fetters bear,\nAntiquity no pleasure gave,\nThe moderns of the ancients rave – \nBooks he abandoned like the fair,\nHis book-shelf instantly doth drape\nWith taffety instead of crape.

XXXIX
Having abjured the haunts of men,\nLike him renouncing vanity,\nHis friendship I acquired just then;\nHis character attracted me.\nAn innate love of meditation,\nOriginal imagination,\nAnd cool sagacious mind he had:\nI was incensed and he was sad.\nBoth were of passion satiate\nAnd both of dull existence tired,\nExtinct the flame which once had fired;\nBoth were expectant of the hate\nWith which blind Fortune oft betrays\nThe very morning of our days.

XL
He who hath lived and living, thinks,\nMust e'en despise his kind at last;\nHe who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks\nFrom shades of the relentless past.\nNo fond illusions live to soothe,\nBut memory like a serpent's tooth\nWith late repentance gnaws and stings.\nAll this in many cases brings\nA charm with it in conversation.\nOnegin's speeches I abhorred\nAt first, but soon became inured\nTo the sarcastic observation,\nTo witticisms and taunts half-vicious\nAnd gloomy epigrams malicious.

XLI
How oft, when on a summer night\nTransparent o'er the Neva beamed\nThe firmament in mellow light,\nAnd when the watery mirror gleamed\nNo more with pale Diana's rays,\nWe called to mind our youthful days – \nThe days of love and of romance!\nThen would we muse as in a trance,\nImpressionable for an hour,\nAnd breathe the balmy breath of night;\nAnd like the prisoner's our delight\nWho for the greenwood quits his tower,\nAs on the rapid wings of thought\nThe early days of life we sought.

XLII
Absorbed in melancholy mood\nAnd o'er the granite coping bent,\nOnegin meditative stood,\nE'en as the poet says he leant.\n'Tis silent all! Alone the cries\nOf the night sentinels arise\nAnd from the Millionaya afar\nThe sudden rattling of a car.\nLo! on the sleeping river borne,\nA boat with splashing oar floats by,\nAnd now we hear delightedly\nA jolly song and distant horn;\nBut sweeter in a midnight dream\nTorquato Tasso's strains I deem.

XLIII
Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,\nO Brenta, once more we shall meet\nAnd, inspiration firing me,\nYour magic voices I shall greet,\nWhose tones Apollo's sons inspire,\nAnd after Albion's proud lyre\nPossess my love and sympathy.\nThe nights of golden Italy\nI'll pass beneath the firmament,\nHid in the gondola's dark shade,\nAlone with my Venetian maid,\nNow talkative, now reticent;\nFrom her my lips shall learn the tongue\nOf love which whilom Petrarch sung.

XLIV
When will my hour of freedom come!\nTime, I invoke thee! favouring gales\nAwaiting on the shore I roam\nAnd beckon to the passing sails.\nUpon the highway of the sea\nWhen shall I wing my passage free\nOn waves by tempests curdled o'er!\n'Tis time to quit this weary shore\nSo uncongenial to my mind,\nTo dream upon the sunny strand\nOf Africa, ancestral land,\nOf dreary Russia left behind,\nWherein I felt love's fatal dart,\nWherein I buried left my heart.\n
XLV
Eugene designed with me to start\nAnd visit many a foreign clime,\nBut Fortune cast our lots apart\nFor a protracted space of time.\nJust at that time his father died,\nAnd soon Onegin's door beside\nOf creditors a hungry rout\nTheir claims and explanations shout.\nBut Eugene, hating litigation\nAnd with his lot in life content,\nTo a surrender gave consent,\nSeeing in this no deprivation,\nOr counting on his uncle's death\nAnd what the old man might bequeath.

XLVI
And in reality one day\nThe steward sent a note to tell\nHow sick to death his uncle lay\nAnd wished to say to him farewell.\nHaving this mournful document\nPerused, Eugene in postchaise went\nAnd hastened to his uncle's side,\nBut in his heart dissatisfied,\nHaving for money's sake alone\nSorrow to counterfeit and wail – \nThus we began our little tale – \nBut, to his uncle's mansion flown,\nHe found him on the table laid,\nA due which must to earth be paid.

XLVII
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,\nAnd from the country all around\nHad come both friends and enemies – \nFuneral amateurs abound!\nThe body they consigned to rest,\nAnd then made merry pope and guest,\nWith serious air then went away\nAs men who much had done that day.\nLo! my Onegin rural lord!\nOf mines and meadows, woods and lakes,\nHe now a full possession takes,\nHe who economy abhorred,\nDelighted much his former ways\nTo vary for a few brief days.

XLVIII
For two whole days it seemed a change\nTo wander through the meadows still,\nThe cool dark oaken grove to range,\nTo listen to the rippling rill.\nBut on the third of grove and mead\nHe took no more the slightest heed;\nThey made him feel inclined to doze;\nAnd the conviction soon arose,\nEnnui can in the country dwell\nThough without palaces and streets,\nCards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes;\nOn him spleen mounted sentinel\nAnd like his shadow dogged his life,\nOr better, – like a faithful wife.

XLIX
I was for calm existence made,\nFor rural solitude and dreams,\nMy lyre sings sweeter in the shade\nAnd more imagination teems.\nOn innocent delights I dote,\nUpon my lake I love to float,\nFor law I far niente take\nAnd every morning I awake\nThe child of sloth and liberty.\nI slumber much, a little read,\nOf fleeting glory take no heed.\nIn former years thus did not I\nIn idleness and tranquil joy\nThe happiest days of life employ?

L
Love, flowers, the country, idleness\nAnd fields my joys have ever been;\nI like the difference to express\nBetween myself and my Eugene,\nLest the malicious reader or\nSome one or other editor\nOf keen sarcastic intellect\nHerein my portrait should detect,\nAnd impiously should declare,\nTo sketch myself that I have tried\nLike Byron, bard of scorn and pride,\nAs if impossible it were\nTo write of any other elf\nThan one's own fascinating self.

LI
Here I remark all poets are\nLove to idealize inclined;\nI have dreamed many a vision fair\nAnd the recesses of my mind\nRetained the image, though short-lived,\nWhich afterwards the muse revived.\nThus carelessly I once portrayed\nMine own ideal, the mountain maid,\nThe captives of the Salguir's shore.\nBut now a question in this wise\nOft upon friendly lips doth rise:\nWhom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?\nTo whom amongst the jealous throng\nOf maids dost thou inscribe thy song?

LII
Whose glance reflecting inspiration\nWith tenderness hath recognized\nThy meditative incantation – \nWhom hath thy strain immortalized?\nNone, be my witness Heaven above!\nThe malady of hopeless love\nI have endured without respite.\nHappy who thereto can unite\nPoetic transport. They impart\nA double force unto their song\nWho following Petrarch move along\nAnd ease the tortures of the heart – \nPerchance they laurels also cull – \nBut I, in love, was mute and dull.

LIII
The Muse appeared, when love passed by\nAnd my dark soul to light was brought;\nFree, I renewed the idolatry\nOf harmony enshrining thought.\nI write, and anguish flies away,\nNor doth my absent pen portray\nAround my stanzas incomplete\nYoung ladies' faces and their feet.\nExtinguished ashes do not blaze – \nI mourn, but tears I cannot shed – \nSoon, of the tempest which hath fled\nTime will the ravages efface – \nWhen that time comes, a poem I'll strive\nTo write in cantos twenty-five.

LIV
I've thought well o'er the general plan,\nThe hero's name too in advance,\nMeantime I'll finish whilst I can\nCanto the First of this romance.\nI've scanned it with a jealous eye,\nDiscovered much absurdity,\nBut will not modify a tittle – \nI owe the censorship a little.\nFor journalistic deglutition\nI yield the fruit of work severe.\nGo, on the Neva's bank appear,\nMy very latest composition!\nEnjoy the meed which Fame bestows – \nMisunderstanding, words and blows.

Canto

I
The village wherein yawned Eugene\nWas a delightful little spot,\nThere friends of pure delight had been\nGrateful to Heaven for their lot.\nThe lonely mansion-house to screen\nFrom gales a hill behind was seen;\nBefore it ran a stream. Behold!\nAfar, where clothed in green and gold\nMeadows and cornfields are displayed,\nVillages in the distance show\nAnd herds of oxen wandering low;\nWhilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,\nA thick immense neglected grove\nExtended – haunt which Dryads love.

II
'Twas built, the venerable pile,\nAs lordly mansions ought to be,\nIn solid, unpretentious style,\nThe style of wise antiquity.\nLofty the chambers one and all,\nSilk tapestry upon the wall,\nImperial portraits hang around\nAnd stoves of various shapes abound.\nAll this I know is out of date,\nI cannot tell the reason why,\nBut Eugene, incontestably,\nThe matter did not agitate,\nBecause he yawned at the bare view\nOf drawing-rooms or old or new.

III
He took the room wherein the old\nMan – forty years long in this wise – \nHis housekeeper was wont to scold,\nLook through the window and kill flies.\n'Twas plain – an oaken floor ye scan,\nTwo cupboards, table, soft divan,\nAnd not a speck of dirt descried.\nOnegin oped the cupboards wide.\nIn one he doth accounts behold,\nHere bottles stand in close array,\nThere jars of cider block the way,\nAn almanac but eight years old.\nHis uncle, busy man indeed,\nNo other book had time to read.

IV
Alone amid possessions great,\nEugene at first began to dream,\nIf but to lighten Time's dull rate,\nOf many an economic scheme;\nThis anchorite amid his waste\nThe ancient barshtchina replaced\nBy an obrok's indulgent rate:\nThe peasant blessed his happy fate.\nBut this a heinous crime appeared\nUnto his neighbour, man of thrift,\nWho secretly denounced the gift,\nAnd many another slily sneered;\nAnd all with one accord agreed,\nHe was a dangerous fool indeed.

V
All visited him at first, of course;\nBut since to the backdoor they led\nMost usually a Cossack horse\nUpon the Don's broad pastures bred\nIf they but heard domestic loads\nCome rumbling up the neighbouring roads,\nMost by this circumstance offended\nAll overtures of friendship ended.\n"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!\nHe's a freemason, so we think.\nAlone he doth his claret drink,\nA lady's hand doth never kiss.\n'Tis yes! no! never madam! sir!”\nThis was his social character.

VI
Into the district then to boot\nA new proprietor arrived,\nFrom whose analysis minute\nThe neighbourhood fresh sport derived.\nVladimir Lenski was his name,\nFrom Gottingen inspired he came,\nA worshipper of Kant, a bard,\nA young and handsome galliard.\nHe brought from mystic Germany\nThe fruits of learning and combined\nA fiery and eccentric mind,\nIdolatry of liberty,\nA wild enthusiastic tongue,\nBlack curls which to his shoulders hung.

VII
The pervert world with icy chill\nHad not yet withered his young breast.\nHis heart reciprocated still\nWhen Friendship smiled or Love caressed.\nHe was a dear delightful fool – \nA nursling yet for Hope to school.\nThe riot of the world and glare\nStill sovereigns of his spirit were,\nAnd by a sweet delusion he\nWould soothe the doubtings of his soul,\nHe deemed of human life the goal\nTo be a charming mystery:\nHe racked his brains to find its clue\nAnd marvels deemed he thus should view.

VIII
This he believed: a kindred spirit\nImpelled to union with his own\nLay languishing both day and night – \nWaiting his coming – his alone!\nHe deemed his friends but longed to make\nGreat sacrifices for his sake!\nThat a friend's arm in every case\nFelled a calumniator base!\nThat chosen heroes consecrate,\nFriends of the sons of every land,\nExist – that their immortal band\nShall surely, be it soon or late,\nPour on this orb a dazzling light\nAnd bless mankind with full delight.

IX
Compassion now or wrath inspires\nAnd now philanthropy his soul,\nAnd now his youthful heart desires\nThe path which leads to glory's goal.\nHis harp beneath that sky had rung\nWhere sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,\nAnd at the altar of their fame\nHe kindled his poetic flame.\nBut from the Muses' loftiest height\nThe gifted songster never swerved,\nBut proudly in his song preserved\nAn ever transcendental flight;\nHis transports were quite maidenly,\nCharming with grave simplicity.

X
He sang of love – to love a slave.\nHis ditties were as pure and bright\nAs thoughts which gentle maidens have,\nAs a babe's slumber, or the light\nOf the moon in the tranquil skies,\nGoddess of lovers' tender sighs.\nHe sang of separation grim,\nOf what not, and of distant dim,\nOf roses to romancers dear;\nTo foreign lands he would allude,\nWhere long time he in solitude\nHad let fall many a bitter tear:\nHe sang of life's fresh colours stained\nBefore he eighteen years attained.

XI
Since Eugene in that solitude\nGifts such as these alone could prize,\nA scant attendance Lenski showed\nAt neighbouring hospitalities.\nHe shunned those parties boisterous;\nThe conversation tedious\nAbout the crop of hay, the wine,\nThe kennel or a kindred line,\nWas certainly not erudite\nNor sparkled with poetic fire,\nNor wit, nor did the same inspire\nA sense of social delight,\nBut still more stupid did appear\nThe gossip of their ladies fair.

XII
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood\nLenski as a good match received, – \nSuch is the country custom good;\nAll mothers their sweet girls believed\nSuitable for this semi-Russian.\nHe enters: rapidly discussion\nShifts, tacks about, until they prate\nThe sorrows of a single state.\nPerchance where Dunia pours out tea\nThe young proprietor we find;\nTo Dunia then they whisper: Mind!\nAnd a guitar produced we see,\nAnd Heavens! warbled forth we hear:\n"Come to my golden palace, dear”!

XIII
But Lenski, having no desire\nVows matrimonial to break,\nWith our Onegin doth aspire\nAcquaintance instantly to make.\nThey met. Earth, water, prose and verse,\nOr ice and flame, are not diverse\nIf they were similar in aught.\nAt first such contradictions wrought\nMutual repulsion and ennui,\nBut grown familiar side by side\nOn horseback every day they ride – \nInseparable soon they be.\nThus oft – this I myself confess – \nMen become friends from idleness.

XIV
But even thus not now-a-days!\nIn spite of common sense we're wont\nAs cyphers others to appraise,\nOurselves as unities to count;\nAnd like Napoleons each of us\nA million bipeds reckons thus\nOne instrument for his own use – \nFeeling is silly, dangerous.\nEugene, more tolerant than this\n(Though certainly mankind he knew\nAnd usually despised it too),\nExceptionless as no rule is,\nA few of different temper deemed,\nFeeling in others much esteemed.

XV
With smiling face he Lenski hears;\nThe poet's fervid conversation\nAnd judgment which unsteady veers\nAnd eye which gleams with inspiration – \nAll this was novel to Eugene.\nThe cold reply with gloomy mien\nHe oft upon his lips would curb,\nThinking: 'tis foolish to disturb\nThis evanescent boyish bliss.\nTime without me will lessons give,\nSo meantime let him joyous live\nAnd deem the world perfection is!\nForgive the fever youth inspires,\nAnd youthful madness, youthful fires.

XVI
The gulf between them was so vast,\nDebate commanded ample food – \nThe laws of generations past,\nThe fruits of science, evil, good,\nThe prejudices all men have,\nThe fatal secrets of the grave,\nAnd life and fate in turn selected\nWere to analysis subjected.\nThe fervid poet would recite,\nCarried away by ecstasy,\nFragments of northern poetry,\nWhilst Eugene condescending quite,\nThough scarcely following what was said,\nAttentive listened to the lad.

XVII
But more the passions occupy\nThe converse of our hermits twain,\nAnd, heaving a regretful sigh,\nAn exile from their troublous reign,\nEugene would speak regarding these.\nThrice happy who their agonies\nHath suffered but indifferent grown,\nStill happier he who ne'er hath known!\nBy absence who hath chilled his love,\nHis hate by slander, and who spends\nExistence without wife or friends,\nWhom jealous transport cannot move,\nAnd who the rent-roll of his race\nNe'er trusted to the treacherous ace.

XVIII
When, wise at length, we seek repose\nBeneath the flag of Quietude,\nWhen Passion's fire no longer glows\nAnd when her violence reviewed – \nEach gust of temper, silly word,\nSeems so unnatural and absurd:\nReduced with effort unto sense,\nWe hear with interest intense\nThe accents wild of other's woes,\nThey stir the heart as heretofore.\nSo ancient warriors, battles o'er,\nA curious interest disclose\nIn yarns of youthful troopers gay,\nLost in the hamlet far away.

XIX
And in addition youth is flame\nAnd cannot anything conceal,\nIs ever ready to proclaim\nThe love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.\nDeeming himself a veteran scarred\nIn love's campaigns Onegin heard\nWith quite a lachrymose expression\nThe youthful poet's fond confession.\nHe with an innocence extreme\nHis inner consciousness laid bare,\nAnd Eugene soon discovered there\nThe story of his young love's dream,\nWhere plentifully feelings flow\nWhich we experienced long ago.

XX
Alas! he loved as in our times\nMen love no more, as only the\nMad spirit of the man who rhymes\nIs still condemned in love to be;\nOne image occupied his mind,\nConstant affection intertwined\nAnd an habitual sense of pain;\nAnd distance interposed in vain,\nNor years of separation all\nNor homage which the Muse demands\nNor beauties of far distant lands\nNor study, banquet, rout nor ball\nHis constant soul could ever tire,\nWhich glowed with virginal desire.

XXI
When but a boy he Olga loved\nUnknown as yet the aching heart,\nHe witnessed tenderly and moved\nHer girlish gaiety and sport.\nBeneath the sheltering oak tree's shade\nHe with his little maiden played,\nWhilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,\nDreamed in the future man and wife.\nAnd full of innocent delight,\nAs in a thicket's humble shade,\nBeneath her parents' eyes the maid\nGrew like a lily pure and white,\nUnseen in thick and tangled grass\nBy bee and butterfly which pass.

XXII
'Twas she who first within his breast\nPoetic transport did infuse,\nAnd thoughts of Olga first impressed\nA mournful temper on his Muse.\nFarewell! thou golden days of love!\n'Twas then he loved the tangled grove\nAnd solitude and calm delight,\nThe moon, the stars, and shining night – \nThe moon, the lamp of heaven above,\nTo whom we used to consecrate\nA promenade in twilight late\nWith tears which secret sufferers love – \nBut now in her effulgence pale\nA substitute for lamps we hail!

XXIII
Obedient she had ever been\nAnd modest, cheerful as the morn,\nAs a poetic life serene,\nSweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.\nHer eyes were of cerulean blue,\nHer locks were of a golden hue,\nHer movements, voice and figure slight,\nAll about Olga – to a light\nRomance of love I pray refer,\nYou'll find her portrait there, I vouch;\nI formerly admired her much\nBut finally grew bored by her.\nBut with her elder sister I\nMust now my stanzas occupy.

XXIV
Tattiana was her appellation.\nWe are the first who such a name\nIn pages of a love narration\nWith such a perversity proclaim.\nBut wherefore not? – 'Tis pleasant, nice,\nEuphonious, though I know a spice\nIt carries of antiquity\nAnd of the attic. Honestly,\nWe must admit but little taste\nDoth in us or our names appear\n(I speak not of our poems here),\nAnd education runs to waste,\nEndowing us from out her store\nWith affectation, – nothing more.

XXV
And so Tattiana was her name,\nNor by her sister's brilliancy\nNor by her beauty she became\nThe cynosure of every eye.\nShy, silent did the maid appear\nAs in the timid forest deer,\nEven beneath her parents' roof\nStood as estranged from all aloof,\nNearest and dearest knew not how\nTo fawn upon and love express;\nA child devoid of childishness\nTo romp and play she ne'er would go:\nOft staring through the window pane\nWould she in silence long remain.

XXVI
Contemplativeness, her delight,\nE'en from her cradle's earliest dream,\nAdorned with many a vision bright\nOf rural life the sluggish stream;\nNe'er touched her fingers indolent\nThe needle nor, o'er framework bent,\nWould she the canvas tight enrich\nWith gay design and silken stitch.\nDesire to rule ye may observe\nWhen the obedient doll in sport\nAn infant maiden doth exhort\nPolite demeanour to preserve,\nGravely repeating to another\nRecent instructions of its mother.

XXVII
But Tania ne'er displayed a passion\nFor dolls, e'en from her earliest years,\nAnd gossip of the town and fashion\nShe ne'er repeated unto hers.\nStrange unto her each childish game,\nBut when the winter season came\nAnd dark and drear the evenings were,\nTerrible tales she loved to hear.\nAnd when for Olga nurse arrayed\nIn the broad meadow a gay rout,\nAll the young people round about,\nAt prisoner's base she never played.\nTheir noisy laugh her soul annoyed,\nTheir giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.

XXVIII
She loved upon the balcony\nTo anticipate the break of day,\nWhen on the pallid eastern sky\nThe starry beacons fade away,\nThe horizon luminous doth grow,\nMorning's forerunners, breezes blow\nAnd gradually day unfolds.\nIn winter, when Night longer holds\nA hemisphere beneath her sway,\nLonger the East inert reclines\nBeneath the moon which dimly shines,\nAnd calmly sleeps the hours away,\nAt the same hour she oped her eyes\nAnd would by candlelight arise.

XXIX
Romances pleased her from the first,\nHer all in all did constitute;\nIn love adventures she was versed,\nRousseau and Richardson to boot.\nNot a bad fellow was her father\nThough superannuated rather;\nIn books he saw nought to condemn\nBut, as he never opened them,\nViewed them with not a little scorn,\nAnd gave himself but little pain\nHis daughter's book to ascertain\nWhich 'neath her pillow lay till morn.\nHis wife was also mad upon\nThe works of Mr. Richardson.

XXX
She was thus fond of Richardson\nNot that she had his works perused,\nOr that adoring Grandison\nThat rascal Lovelace she abused;\nBut that Princess Pauline of old,\nHer Moscow cousin, often told\nThe tale of these romantic men;\nHer husband was a bridegroom then,\nAnd she despite herself would waste\nSighs on another than her lord\nWhose qualities appeared to afford\nMore satisfaction to her taste.\nHer Grandison was in the Guard,\nA noted fop who gambled hard.

XXXI
Like his, her dress was always nice,\nThe height of fashion, fitting tight,\nBut contrary to her advice\nThe girl in marriage they unite.\nThen, her distraction to allay,\nThe bridegroom sage without delay\nRemoved her to his country seat,\nWhere God alone knows whom she met.\nShe struggled hard at first thus pent,\nNight separated from her spouse,\nThen became busy with the house,\nFirst reconciled and then content;\nHabit was given us in distress\nBy Heaven in lieu of happiness.

XXXII
Habit alleviates the grief\nInseparable from our lot;\nThis great discovery relief\nAnd consolation soon begot.\nAnd then she soon 'twixt work and leisure\nFound out the secret how at pleasure\nTo dominate her worthy lord,\nAnd harmony was soon restored.\nThe workpeople she superintended,\nMushrooms for winter salted down,\nKept the accounts, shaved many a crown,\nThe bath on Saturdays attended,\nWhen angry beat her maids, I grieve,\nAnd all without her husband's leave.

XXXIII
In her friends' albums, time had been,\nWith blood instead of ink she scrawled,\nBaptized Prascovia Pauline,\nAnd in her conversation drawled.\nShe wore her corset tightly bound,\nThe Russian N with nasal sound\nShe would pronounce a la Francaise;\nBut soon she altered all her ways,\nCorset and album and Pauline,\nHer sentimental verses all,\nShe soon forgot, began to call\nAkulka who was once Celine,\nAnd had with waddling in the end\nHer caps and night-dresses to mend.

XXXIV
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,\nIn her affairs ne'er interfered,\nEntrusted all to her sincerely,\nIn dressing-gown at meals appeared.\nExistence calmly sped along,\nAnd oft at eventide a throng\nOf friends unceremonious would\nAssemble from the neighbourhood:\nThey growl a bit – they scandalise – \nThey crack a feeble joke and smile – \nThus the time passes and meanwhile\nOlga the tea must supervise – \n'Tis time for supper, now for bed,\nAnd soon the friendly troop hath fled.

XXXV
They in a peaceful life preserved\nCustoms by ages sanctified,\nStrictly the Carnival observed,\nAte Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,\nTwice in the year to fast were bound,\nOf whirligigs were very fond,\nOf Christmas carols, song and dance;\nWhen people with long countenance\nOn Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,\nThree tears they dropt with humble mein\nUpon a bunch of lovage green;\nKvass needful was to them as air;\nOn guests their servants used to wait\nBy rank as settled by the State.

XXXVI
Thus age approached, the common doom,\nAnd death before the husband wide\nOpened the portals of the tomb\nAnd a new diadem supplied.\nJust before dinner-time he slept,\nBy neighbouring families bewept,\nBy children and by faithful wife\nWith deeper woe than others' grief.\nHe was an honest gentleman,\nAnd where at last his bones repose\nThe epitaph on marble shows:\nDemetrius Larine, sinful man,\nServant of God and brigadier,\nEnjoyeth peaceful slumber here.

XXXVII
To his Penates now returned,\nVladimir Lenski visited\nHis neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned\nAbove the ashes of the dead.\nThere long time sad at heart he stayed:\n"Poor Yorick,” mournfully he said,\n"How often in thine arms I lay;\nHow with thy medal I would play,\nThe Medal Otchakoff conferred!\nTo me he would his Olga give,\nWould whisper: shall I so long live?” – \nAnd by a genuine sorrow stirred,\nLenski his pencil-case took out\nAnd an elegiac poem wrote.

XXXVIII
Likewise an epitaph with tears\nHe writes upon his parents' tomb,\nAnd thus ancestral dust reveres.\nOh! on the fields of life how bloom\nHarvests of souls unceasingly\nBy Providence's dark decree!\nThey blossom, ripen and they fall\nAnd others rise ephemeral!\nThus our light race grows up and lives,\nA moment effervescing stirs,\nThen seeks ancestral sepulchres,\nThe appointed hour arrives, arrives!\nAnd our successors soon shall drive\nUs from the world wherein we live.

XXXIX
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow\nOf frivolous existence, friends;\nIts insignificance I know\nAnd care but little for its ends.\nTo dreams I long have closed mine eyes,\nYet sometimes banished hopes will rise\nAnd agitate my heart again;\nAnd thus it is 'twould cause me pain\nWithout the faintest trace to leave\nThis world. I do not praise desire,\nYet still apparently aspire\nMy mournful fate in verse to weave,\nThat like a friendly voice its tone\nRescue me from oblivion.

XL
Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,\nAnd then the stanzas of my theme\nWill not, preserved by kindly Fate,\nPerish absorbed by Lethe's stream.\nThen it may be, O flattering tale,\nSome future ignoramus shall\nMy famous portrait indicate\nAnd cry: he was a poet great!\nMy gratitude do not disdain,\nAdmirer of the peaceful Muse,\nWhose memory doth not refuse\nMy light productions to retain,\nWhose hands indulgently caress\nThe bays of age and helplessness.

Canto

I
"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!” – \n"Good-bye, Onegin, I must go.” – \n"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard\nTo guess how you the eve pull through.” – \n"At Larina's.” – "Hem, that is queer!\nPray is it not a tough affair\nThus to assassinate the eve?” – \n"Not at all.” – "That I can't conceive!\n'Tis something of this sort I deem.\nIn the first place, say, am I right?\nA Russian household simple quite,\nWho welcome guests with zeal extreme,\nPreserves and an eternal prattle\nAbout the rain and flax and cattle.” –

II
"No misery I see in that” – \n"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill – ”\n"Your fashionable world I hate,\nDomestic life attracts me still,\nWhere – « – »What! another eclogue spin?\nFor God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!\nWhat! really going? 'Tis too bad!\nBut Lenski, I should be so glad\nWould you to me this Phyllis show,\nFair source of every fine idea,\nVerses and tears et cetera.\nPresent me.« – »You are joking.« – »No.” – \n"Delighted.” – "When?” – "This very night.\nThey will receive us with delight.”

III
Whilst homeward by the nearest route\nOur heroes at full gallop sped,\nCan we not stealthily make out\nWhat they in conversation said? – \n"How now, Onegin, yawning still?” – \n"'Tis habit, Lenski.” – "Is your ill\nMore troublesome than usual?« – »No!\nHow dark the night is getting though!\nHallo, Andriushka, onward race!\nThe drive becomes monotonous – \nWell! Larina appears to us\nAn ancient lady full of grace. – \nThat bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,\nThe deuce with my inside has played.”

IV
"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?”\n"She who with melancholy face\nAnd silent as the maid Svetlana\nHard by the window took her place.” – \n"The younger, you're in love with her!”\n"Well!” – "I the elder should prefer,\nWere I like you a bard by trade – \nIn Olga's face no life's displayed.\n'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,\nAn oval countenance and pink,\nYon silly moon upon the brink\nOf the horizon she is like!” – \nVladimir something curtly said\nNor further comment that night made.

V
Meantime Onegin's apparition\nAt Larina's abode produced\nQuite a sensation; the position\nTo all good neighbours' sport conduced.\nEndless conjectures all propound\nAnd secretly their views expound.\nWhat jokes and guesses now abound,\nA beau is for Tattiana found!\nIn fact, some people were assured\nThe wedding-day had been arranged,\nBut the date subsequently changed\nTill proper rings could be procured.\nOn Lenski's matrimonial fate\nThey long ago had held debate.

VI
Of course Tattiana was annoyed\nBy such allusions scandalous,\nYet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed\nWith satisfaction marvellous,\nAs in her heart the thought sank home,\nI am in love, my hour hath come!\nThus in the earth the seed expands\nObedient to warm Spring's commands.\nLong time her young imagination\nBy indolence and languor fired\nThe fated nutriment desired;\nAnd long internal agitation\nHad filled her youthful breast with gloom,\nShe waited for – I don't know whom!

VII
The fatal hour had come at last – \nShe oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!\nAlas! for now before her passed\nThe same warm vision constantly;\nNow all things round about repeat\nCeaselessly to the maiden sweet\nHis name: the tenderness of home\nTiresome unto her hath become\nAnd the kind-hearted servitors:\nImmersed in melancholy thought,\nShe hears of conversation nought\nAnd hated casual visitors,\nTheir coming which no man expects,\nAnd stay whose length none recollects.

VIII
Now with what eager interest\nShe the delicious novel reads,\nWith what avidity and zest\nShe drinks in those seductive deeds!\nAll the creations which below\nFrom happy inspiration flow,\nThe swain of Julia Wolmar,\nMalek Adel and De Linar,\nWerther, rebellious martyr bold,\nAnd that unrivalled paragon,\nThe sleep-compelling Grandison,\nOur tender dreamer had enrolled\nA single being: 'twas in fine\nNo other than Onegin mine.

IX
Dreaming herself the heroine\nOf the romances she preferred,\nClarissa, Julia, Delphine, –\nTattiana through the forest erred,\nAnd the bad book accompanies.\nUpon those pages she descries\nHer passion's faithful counterpart,\nFruit of the yearnings of the heart.\nShe heaves a sigh and deep intent\nOn raptures, sorrows not her own,\nShe murmurs in an undertone\nA letter for her hero meant:\nThat hero, though his merit shone,\nWas certainly no Grandison.

X
Alas! my friends, the years flit by\nAnd after them at headlong pace\nThe evanescent fashions fly\nIn motley and amusing chase.\nThe world is ever altering!\nFarthingales, patches, were the thing,\nAnd courtier, fop, and usurer\nWould once in powdered wig appear;\nTime was, the poet's tender quill\nIn hopes of everlasting fame\nA finished madrigal would frame\nOr couplets more ingenious still;\nTime was, a valiant general might\nServe who could neither read nor write.

XI
Time was, in style magniloquent\nAuthors replete with sacred fire\nTheir heroes used to represent\nAll that perfection could desire;\nEver by adverse fate oppressed,\nTheir idols they were wont to invest\nWith intellect, a taste refined,\nAnd handsome countenance combined,\nA heart wherein pure passion burnt;\nThe excited hero in a trice\nWas ready for self-sacrifice,\nAnd in the final tome we learnt,\nVice had due punishment awarded,\nVirtue was with a bride rewarded.

XII
But now our minds are mystified\nAnd Virtue acts as a narcotic,\nVice in romance is glorified\nAnd triumphs in career erotic.\nThe monsters of the British Muse\nDeprive our schoolgirls of repose,\nThe idols of their adoration\nA Vampire fond of meditation,\nOr Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,\nThe Eternal Jew or the Corsair\nOr the mysterious Sbogar.\nByron's capricious phantasy\nCould in romantic mantle drape\nE'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.

XIII
My friends, what means this odd digression?\nMay be that I by heaven's decrees\nShall abdicate the bard's profession,\nAnd shall adopt some new caprice.\nThus having braved Apollo's rage\nWith humble prose I'll fill my page\nAnd a romance in ancient style\nShall my declining years beguile;\nNor shall my pen paint terribly\nThe torment born of crime unseen,\nBut shall depict the touching scene\nOf Russian domesticity;\nI will descant on love's sweet dream,\nThe olden time shall be my theme.

XIV
Old people's simple conversations\nMy unpretending page shall fill,\nTheir offspring's innocent flirtations\nBy the old lime-tree or the rill,\nTheir Jealousy and separation\nAnd tears of reconciliation:\nFresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,\nBut finally in wedlock bind.\nThe passionate speeches I'll repeat,\nAccents of rapture or despair\nI uttered to my lady fair\nLong ago, prostrate at her feet.\nThen they came easily enow,\nMy tongue is somewhat rusty now.

XV
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!\nWhat bitter tears with thee I shed!\nThou hast resigned thy destiny\nUnto a ruthless tyrant dread.\nThou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,\nHope with her fascinating power\nTo dire contentment shall give birth\nAnd thou shalt taste the joys of earth.\nThou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,\nFantastic images shall swarm\nIn thy imagination warm,\nOf happy meetings thou shalt dream,\nAnd wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,\nConfront thy fated torturer!

XVI
Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.\nShe seeks the garden in her need – \nSudden she stops, casts down her eyes\nAnd cares not farther to proceed;\nHer bosom heaves whilst crimson hues\nWith sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,\nBarely to draw her breath she seems,\nHer eye with fire unwonted gleams.\nAnd now 'tis night, the guardian moon\nSails her allotted course on high,\nAnd from the misty woodland nigh\nThe nightingale trills forth her tune;\nRestless Tattiana sleepless lay\nAnd thus unto her nurse did say:

XVII
"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.\nOpen the window – sit by me.”\n"What ails thee, dear?” – "I feel depressed.\nRelate some ancient history.”\n"But which, my dear? – In days of yore\nWithin my memory I bore\nMany an ancient legend which\nIn monsters and fair dames was rich;\nBut now my mind is desolate,\nWhat once I knew is clean forgot – \nAlas! how wretched now my lot!”\n"But tell me, nurse, can you relate\nThe days which to your youth belong?\nWere you in love when you were young?” –

XVIII
"Alack! Tattiana,” she replied,\n"We never loved in days of old,\nMy mother-in-law who lately died\nHad killed me had the like been told.”\n"How came you then to wed a man?” – \n"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan\nWas younger than myself, my light,\nFor I myself was thirteen quite;\nThe matchmaker a fortnight sped,\nHer suit before my parents pressing:\nAt last my father gave his blessing,\nAnd bitter tears of fright I shed.\nWeeping they loosed my tresses long\nAnd led me off to church with song.”

XIX
"Then amongst strangers I was left – \nBut I perceive thou dost not heed – ”\n"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,\nMortally sick I am indeed.\nBehold, my sobs I scarce restrain – ”\n"My darling child, thou art in pain. – \nThe Lord deliver her and save!\nTell me at once what wilt thou have?\nI'll sprinkle thee with holy water. – \nHow thy hands burn!« – »Dear nurse, I'm well.\nI am – in love – you know – don't tell!”\n"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!” – \nAnd the old nurse a brief prayer said\nAnd crossed with trembling hand the maid.

XX
"I am in love,” her whispers tell\nThe aged woman in her woe:\n"My heart's delight, thou art not well.” – \n"I am in love, nurse! leave me now.”\nBehold! the moon was shining bright\nAnd showed with an uncertain light\nTattiana's beauty, pale with care,\nHer tears and her dishevelled hair;\nAnd on the footstool sitting down\nBeside our youthful heroine fair,\nA kerchief round her silver hair\nThe aged nurse in ample gown,\nWhilst all creation seemed to dream\nEnchanted by the moon's pale beam.

XXI
But borne in spirit far away\nTattiana gazes on the moon,\nAnd starting suddenly doth say:\n"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.\nPen, paper bring: the table too\nDraw near. I soon to sleep shall go – \nGood-night.” Behold! she is alone!\n'Tis silent – on her shines the moon – \nUpon her elbow she reclines,\nAnd Eugene ever in her soul\nIndites an inconsiderate scroll\nWherein love innocently pines.\nNow it is ready to be sent – \nFor whom, Tattiana, is it meant?

XXII
I have known beauties cold and raw\nAs Winter in their purity,\nStriking the intellect with awe\nBy dull insensibility,\nAnd I admired their common sense\nAnd natural benevolence,\nBut, I acknowledge, from them fled;\nFor on their brows I trembling read\nThe inscription o'er the gates of Hell\n"Abandon hope for ever here!”\nLove to inspire doth woe appear\nTo such – delightful to repel.\nPerchance upon the Neva e'en\nSimilar dames ye may have seen.

XXIII
Amid submissive herds of men\nVirgins miraculous I see,\nWho selfishly unmoved remain\nAlike by sighs and flattery.\nBut what astonished do I find\nWhen harsh demeanour hath consigned\nA timid love to banishment? – \nOn fresh allurements they are bent,\nAt least by show of sympathy;\nAt least their accents and their words\nAppear attuned to softer chords;\nAnd then with blind credulity\nThe youthful lover once again\nPursues phantasmagoria vain.

XXIV
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed? – \nBecause in singleness of thought\nShe never of deception dreamed\nBut trusted the ideal she wrought? – \nBecause her passion wanted art,\nObeyed the impulses of heart? – \nBecause she was so innocent,\nThat Heaven her character had blent\nWith an imagination wild,\nWith intellect and strong volition\nAnd a determined disposition,\nAn ardent heart and yet so mild? – \nDoth love's incautiousness in her\nSo irremissible appear?

XXV
O ye whom tender love hath pained\nWithout the ken of parents both,\nWhose hearts responsive have remained\nTo the impressions of our youth,\nThe all-entrancing joys of love – \nYoung ladies, if ye ever strove\nThe mystic lines to tear away\nA lover's letter might convey,\nOr into bold hands anxiously\nHave e'er a precious tress consigned,\nOr even, silent and resigned,\nWhen separation's hour drew nigh,\nHave felt love's agitated kiss\nWith tears, confused emotions, bliss, –

XXVI
With unanimity complete,\nCondemn not weak Tattiana mine;\nDo not cold-bloodedly repeat\nThe sneers of critics superfine;\nAnd you, O maids immaculate,\nWhom vice, if named, doth agitate\nE'en as the presence of a snake,\nI the same admonition make.\nWho knows? with love's consuming flame\nPerchance you also soon may burn,\nThen to some gallant in your turn\nWill be ascribed by treacherous Fame\nThe triumph of a conquest new.\nThe God of Love is after you!

XXVII
A coquette loves by calculation,\nTattiana's love was quite sincere,\nA love which knew no limitation,\nEven as the love of children dear.\nShe did not think "procrastination\nEnhances love in estimation\nAnd thus secures the prey we seek.\nHis vanity first let us pique\nWith hope and then perplexity,\nExcruciate the heart and late\nWith jealous fire resuscitate,\nLest jaded with satiety,\nThe artful prisoner should seek\nIncessantly his chains to break.”

XXVIII
I still a complication view,\nMy country's honour and repute\nDemands that I translate for you\nThe letter which Tattiana wrote.\nAt Russ she was by no means clever\nAnd read our newspapers scarce ever,\nAnd in her native language she\nPossessed nor ease nor fluency,\nSo she in French herself expressed.\nI cannot help it I declare,\nThough hitherto a lady ne'er\nIn Russ her love made manifest,\nAnd never hath our language proud\nIn correspondence been allowed.

XXIX
They wish that ladies should, I hear,\nLearn Russian, but the Lord defend!\nI can't conceive a little dear\nWith the "Well-Wisher” in her hand!\nI ask, all ye who poets are,\nIs it not true? the objects fair,\nTo whom ye for unnumbered crimes\nHad to compose in secret rhymes,\nTo whom your hearts were consecrate, – \nDid they not all the Russian tongue\nWith little knowledge and that wrong\nIn charming fashion mutilate?\nDid not their lips with foreign speech\nThe native Russian tongue impeach?

XXX
God grant I meet not at a ball\nOr at a promenade mayhap,\nA schoolmaster in yellow shawl\nOr a professor in tulle cap.\nAs rosy lips without a smile,\nThe Russian language I deem vile\nWithout grammatical mistakes.\nMay be, and this my terror wakes,\nThe fair of the next generation,\nAs every journal now entreats,\nWill teach grammatical conceits,\nIntroduce verse in conversation.\nBut I – what is all this to me?\nWill to the old times faithful be.

XXXI
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,\nWith inexact pronunciation\nRaises within my breast as oft\nAs formerly much agitation.\nRepentance wields not now her spell\nAnd gallicisms I love as well\nAs the sins of my youthful days\nOr Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.\nBut I must now employ my Muse\nWith the epistle of my fair;\nI promised! – Did I so? – Well, there!\nNow I am ready to refuse.\nI know that Parny's tender pen\nIs no more cherished amongst men.

XXXII
Bard of the "Feasts,” and mournful breast,\nIf thou wert sitting by my side,\nWith this immoderate request\nI should alarm our friendship tried:\nIn one of thine enchanting lays\nTo russify the foreign phrase\nOf my impassioned heroine.\nWhere art thou? Come! pretensions mine\nI yield with a low reverence;\nBut lonely beneath Finnish skies\nWhere melancholy rocks arise\nHe wanders in his indolence;\nCareless of fame his spirit high\nHears not my importunity!

XXXIII
Tattiana's letter I possess,\nI guard it as a holy thing,\nAnd though I read it with distress,\nI'm o'er it ever pondering.\nInspired by whom this tenderness,\nThis gentle daring who could guess?\nWho this soft nonsense could impart,\nImprudent prattle of the heart,\nAttractive in its banefulness?\nI cannot understand. But lo!\nA feeble version read below,\nA print without the picture's grace,\nOr, as it were, the Freischutz' score\nStrummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.

*Tattiana's Letter to Onegin*
I write to you! Is more required?\nCan lower depths beyond remain?\n'Tis in your power now, if desired,\nTo crush me with a just disdain.\nBut if my lot unfortunate\nYou in the least commiserate\nYou will not all abandon me.\nAt first, I clung to secrecy:\nBelieve me, of my present shame\nYou never would have heard the name,\nIf the fond hope I could have fanned\nAt times, if only once a week,\nTo see you by our fireside stand,\nTo listen to the words you speak,\nAddress to you one single phrase\nAnd then to meditate for days\nOf one thing till again we met.\n'Tis said you are a misanthrope,\nIn country solitude you mope,\nAnd we – an unattractive set – \nCan hearty welcome give alone.\nWhy did you visit our poor place?\nForgotten in the village lone,\nI never should have seen your face\nAnd bitter torment never known.\nThe untutored spirit's pangs calmed down\nBy time (who can anticipate?)\nI had found my predestinate,\nBecome a faithful wife and e'en\nA fond and careful mother been.\nAnother! to none other I\nMy heart's allegiance can resign,\nMy doom has been pronounced on high,\n'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.\nThe sum of my existence gone\nBut promise of our meeting gave,\nI feel thou wast by God sent down\nMy guardian angel to the grave.\nThou didst to me in dreams appear,\nUnseen thou wast already dear.\nThine eye subdued me with strange glance,\nI heard thy voice's resonance\nLong ago. Dream it cannot be!\nScarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,\nI flushed up, stupefied I grew,\nAnd cried within myself: 'tis he!\nIs it not truth? in tones suppressed\nWith thee I conversed when I bore\nComfort and succour to the poor,\nAnd when I prayer to Heaven addressed\nTo ease the anguish of my breast.\nNay! even as this instant fled,\nWas it not thou, O vision bright,\nThat glimmered through the radiant night\nAnd gently hovered o'er my head?\nWas it not thou who thus didst stoop\nTo whisper comfort, love and hope?\nWho art thou? Guardian angel sent\nOr torturer malevolent?\nDoubt and uncertainty decide:\nAll this may be an empty dream,\nDelusions of a mind untried,\nProvidence otherwise may deem – \nThen be it so! My destiny\nFrom henceforth I confide to thee!\nLo! at thy feet my tears I pour\nAnd thy protection I implore.\nImagine! Here alone am I!\nNo one my anguish comprehends,\nAt times my reason almost bends,\nAnd silently I here must die – \nBut I await thee: scarce alive\nMy heart with but one look revive;\nOr to disturb my dreams approach\nAlas! with merited reproach.\n'Tis finished. Horrible to read!\nWith shame I shudder and with dread – \nBut boldly I myself resign:\nThine honour is my countersign!

XXXIV
Tattiana moans and now she sighs\nAnd in her grasp the letter shakes,\nEven the rosy wafer dries\nUpon her tongue which fever bakes.\nHer head upon her breast declines\nAnd an enchanting shoulder shines\nFrom her half-open vest of night.\nBut lo! already the moon's light\nIs waning. Yonder valley deep\nLooms gray behind the mist and morn\nSilvers the brook; the shepherd's horn\nArouses rustics from their sleep.\n'Tis day, the family downstairs,\nBut nought for this Tattiana cares.

XXXV
The break of day she doth not see,\nBut sits in bed with air depressed,\nNor on the letter yet hath she\nThe image of her seal impressed.\nBut gray Phillippevna the door\nOpened with care, and entering bore\nA cup of tea upon a tray.\n"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!\nMy beauty, thou art ready too.\nMy morning birdie, yesternight\nI was half silly with affright.\nBut praised be God! in health art thou!\nThe pains of night have wholly fled,\nThy cheek is as a poppy red!”

XXXVI
"Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!”\n"Command me, darling, what you choose”\n"Do not – you might – suspicious be;\nBut look you – ah! do not refuse.”\n"I call to witness God on high – ”\n"Then send your grandson quietly\nTo take this letter to O – Well!\nUnto our neighbour. Mind you tell – \nCommand him not to say a word – \nI mean my name not to repeat.”\n"To whom is it to go, my sweet?\nOf late I have been quite absurd, – \nSo many neighbours here exist – \nAm I to go through the whole list?”

XXXVII
"How dull you are this morning, nurse!”\n"My darling, growing old am I!\nIn age the memory gets worse,\nBut I was sharp in times gone by.\nIn times gone by thy bare command – ”\n"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!\nWhat is thy cleverness to me?\nThe letter is the thing, you see, – \nOnegin's letter!« – »Ah! the thing!\nNow don't be cross with me, my soul,\nYou know that I am now a fool – \nBut why are your cheeks whitening?”\n"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,\nBut send your grandson before long.”

XXXVIII
No answer all that day was borne.\nAnother passed; 'twas just the same.\nPale as a ghost and dressed since morn\nTattiana waits. No answer came!\nOlga's admirer came that day:\n"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?”\nThe hostess doth interrogate:\n"He hath neglected us of late.” – \nTattiana blushed, her heart beat quick – \n"He promised here this day to ride,”\nLenski unto the dame replied,\n"The post hath kept him, it is like.”\nShamefaced, Tattiana downward looked\nAs if he cruelly had joked!

XXXIX
'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright\nShrill sang the samovar at eve,\nThe china teapot too ye might\nIn clouds of steam above perceive.\nInto the cups already sped\nBy Olga's hand distributed\nThe fragrant tea in darkling stream,\nAnd a boy handed round the cream.\nTania doth by the casement linger\nAnd breathes upon the chilly glass,\nDreaming of what not, pretty lass,\nAnd traces with a slender finger\nUpon its damp opacity,\nThe mystic monogram, O. E.

XL
In the meantime her spirit sinks,\nHer weary eyes are filled with tears – \nA horse's hoofs she hears – She shrinks!\nNearer they come – Eugene appears!\nAh! than a spectre from the dead\nMore swift the room Tattiana fled,\nFrom hall to yard and garden flies,\nNot daring to cast back her eyes.\nShe fears and like an arrow rushes\nThrough park and meadow, wood and brake,\nThe bridge and alley to the lake,\nBrambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,\nThe flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,\nTill out of breath upon a seat

XLI
She sank. – \n"He's here! Eugene is here!\nMerciful God, what will he deem?”\nYet still her heart, which torments tear,\nGuards fondly hope's uncertain dream.\nShe waits, on fire her trembling frame – \nWill he pursue? – But no one came.\nShe heard of servant-maids the note,\nWho in the orchards gathered fruit,\nSinging in chorus all the while.\n(This by command; for it was found,\nHowever cherries might abound,\nThey disappeared by stealth and guile,\nSo mouths they stopt with song, not fruit – \nDevice of rural minds acute!)

*The Maidens' Song*
Young maidens, fair maidens,\nFriends and companions,\nDisport yourselves, maidens,\nArouse yourselves, fair ones.\nCome sing we in chorus\nThe secrets of maidens.\nAllure the young gallant\nWith dance and with song.\nAs we lure the young gallant,\nEspy him approaching,\nDisperse yourselves, darlings,\nAnd pelt him with cherries,\nWith cherries, red currants,\nWith raspberries, cherries.\nApproach not to hearken\nTo secrets of virgins,\nApproach not to gaze at\nThe frolics of maidens.

XLII
They sang, whilst negligently seated,\nAttentive to the echoing sound,\nTattiana with impatience waited\nUntil her heart less high should bound – \nTill the fire in her cheek decreased;\nBut tremor still her frame possessed,\nNor did her blushes fade away,\nMore crimson every moment they.\nThus shines the wretched butterfly,\nWith iridescent wing doth flap\nWhen captured in a schoolboy's cap;\nThus shakes the hare when suddenly\nShe from the winter corn espies\nA sportsman who in covert lies.

XLIII
But finally she heaves a sigh,\nAnd rising from her bench proceeds;\nBut scarce had turned the corner nigh,\nWhich to the neighbouring alley leads,\nWhen Eugene like a ghost did rise\nBefore her straight with roguish eyes.\nTattiana faltered, and became\nScarlet as burnt by inward flame.\nBut this adventure's consequence\nTo-day, my friends, at any rate,\nI am not strong enough to state;\nI, after so much eloquence,\nMust take a walk and rest a bit – \nSome day I'll somehow finish it.

Canto

I
The less we love a lady fair\nThe easier 'tis to gain her grace,\nAnd the more surely we ensnare\nHer in the pitfalls which we place.\nTime was when cold seduction strove\nTo swagger as the art of love,\nEverywhere trumpeting its feats,\nNot seeking love but sensual sweets.\nBut this amusement delicate\nWas worthy of that old baboon,\nOur fathers used to dote upon;\nThe Lovelaces are out of date,\nTheir glory with their heels of red\nAnd long perukes hath vanished.

II
For who imposture can endure,\nA constant harping on one tune,\nSerious endeavours to assure\nWhat everybody long has known;\nEver to hear the same replies\nAnd overcome antipathies\nWhich never have existed, e'en\nIn little maidens of thirteen?\nAnd what like menaces fatigues,\nEntreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,\nEpistles of six sheets or near,\nRings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,\nAunts, mothers and their scrutiny,\nAnd husbands' tedious amity?

III
Such were the musings of Eugene.\nHe in the early years of life\nHad a deluded victim been\nOf error and the passions' strife.\nBy daily life deteriorated,\nAwhile this beauty captivated,\nAnd that no longer could inspire.\nSlowly exhausted by desire,\nYet satiated with success,\nIn solitude or worldly din,\nHe heard his soul's complaint within,\nWith laughter smothered weariness:\nAnd thus he spent eight years of time,\nDestroyed the blossom of his prime.

IV
Though beauty he no more adored,\nHe still made love in a queer way;\nRebuffed – as quickly reassured,\nJilted – glad of a holiday.\nWithout enthusiasm he met\nThe fair, nor parted with regret,\nScarce mindful of their love and guile.\nThus a guest with composure will\nTo take a hand at whist oft come:\nHe takes his seat, concludes his game,\nAnd straight returning whence he came,\nTranquilly goes to sleep at home,\nAnd in the morning doth not know\nWhither that evening he will go.

V
However, Tania's letter reading,\nEugene was touched with sympathy;\nThe language of her girlish pleading\nAroused in him sweet reverie.\nHe called to mind Tattiana's grace,\nPallid and melancholy face,\nAnd in a vision, sinless, bright,\nHis spirit sank with strange delight.\nMay be the empire of the sense,\nRegained authority awhile,\nBut he desired not to beguile\nSuch open-hearted innocence.\nBut to the garden once again\nWherein we lately left the twain.

VI
Two minutes they in silence spent,\nOnegin then approached and said:\n"You have a letter to me sent.\nDo not excuse yourself. I read\nConfessions which a trusting heart\nMay well in innocence impart.\nCharming is your sincerity,\nFeelings which long had ceased to be\nIt wakens in my breast again.\nBut I came not to adulate:\nYour frankness I shall compensate\nBy an avowal just as plain.\nAn ear to my confession lend;\nTo thy decree my will I bend.

VII
"If the domestic hearth could bless – \nMy sum of happiness contained;\nIf wife and children to possess\nA happy destiny ordained:\nIf in the scenes of home I might\nE'en for an instant find delight,\nThen, I say truly, none but thee\nI would desire my bride to be – \nI say without poetic phrase,\nFound the ideal of my youth,\nThee only would I choose, in truth,\nAs partner of my mournful days,\nThee only, pledge of all things bright,\nAnd be as happy – as I might.

VIII
"But strange am I to happiness;\n'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;\nMe your perfections would not bless;\nI am not worthy them in aught;\nAnd honestly 'tis my belief\nOur union would produce but grief.\nThough now my love might be intense,\nHabit would bring indifference.\nI see you weep. Those tears of yours\nTend not my heart to mitigate,\nBut merely to exasperate;\nJudge then what roses would be ours,\nWhat pleasures Hymen would prepare\nFor us, may be for many a year.

IX
"What can be drearier than the house,\nWherein the miserable wife\nDeplores a most unworthy spouse\nAnd leads a solitary life?\nThe tiresome man, her value knowing,\nYet curses on his fate bestowing,\nIs full of frigid jealousy,\nMute, solemn, frowning gloomily.\nSuch am I. This did ye expect,\nWhen in simplicity ye wrote\nYour innocent and charming note\nWith so much warmth and intellect?\nHath fate apportioned unto thee\nThis lot in life with stern decree?

X
"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;\nMy soul I cannot renovate – \nI love you with a brother's love,\nPerchance one more affectionate.\nListen to me without disdain.\nA maid hath oft, may yet again\nReplace the visions fancy drew;\nThus trees in spring their leaves renew\nAs in their turn the seasons roll.\n'Tis evidently Heaven's will\nYou fall in love again. But still – \nLearn to possess more self-control.\nNot all will like myself proceed – \nAnd thoughtlessness to woe might lead.”

XI
Thus did our friend Onegin preach:\nTattiana, dim with tears her eyes,\nAttentive listened to his speech,\nAll breathless and without replies.\nHis arm he offers. Mute and sad\n(Mechanically, let us add),\nTattiana doth accept his aid;\nAnd, hanging down her head, the maid\nAround the garden homeward hies.\nTogether they returned, nor word\nOf censure for the same incurred;\nThe country hath its liberties\nAnd privileges nice allowed,\nEven as Moscow, city proud.

XII
Confess, O ye who this peruse,\nOnegin acted very well\nBy poor Tattiana in the blues;\n'Twas not the first time, I can tell\nYou, he a noble mind disclosed,\nThough some men, evilly disposed,\nSpared him not their asperities.\nHis friends and also enemies\n(One and the same thing it may be)\nEsteemed him much as the world goes.\nYes! every one must have his foes,\nBut Lord! from friends deliver me!\nThe deuce take friends, my friends, amends\nI've had to make for having friends!

XIII
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss\nDark, unavailing reverie,\nI just hint, in parenthesis,\nThere is no stupid calumny\nBorn of a babbler in a loft\nAnd by the world repeated oft,\nThere is no fishmarket retort\nAnd no ridiculous report,\nWhich your true friend with a sweet smile\nWhere fashionable circles meet\nA hundred times will not repeat,\nQuite inadvertently meanwhile;\nAnd yet he in your cause would strive\nAnd loves you as – a relative!

XIV
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,\nAre all your relatives quite well?\nPermit me; is it worth the trouble\nFor your instruction here to tell\nWhat I by relatives conceive?\nThese are your relatives, believe:\nThose whom we ought to love, caress,\nWith spiritual tenderness;\nWhom, as the custom is of men,\nWe visit about Christmas Day,\nOr by a card our homage pay,\nThat until Christmas comes again\nThey may forget that we exist.\nAnd so – God bless them, if He list.

XV
In this the love of the fair sex\nBeats that of friends and relatives:\nIn love, although its tempests vex,\nOur liberty at least survives:\nAgreed! but then the whirl of fashion,\nThe natural fickleness of passion,\nThe torrent of opinion,\nAnd the fair sex as light as down!\nBesides the hobbies of a spouse\nShould be respected throughout life\nBy every proper-minded wife,\nAnd this the faithful one allows,\nWhen in as instant she is lost, – \nSatan will jest, and at love's cost.

XVI
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?\nWhere is he who doth not deceive?\nWho words and actions will adjust\nTo standards in which we believe?\nOh! who is not calumnious?\nWho labours hard to humour us?\nTo whom are our misfortunes grief\nAnd who is not a tiresome thief?\nMy venerated reader, oh!\nCease the pursuit of shadows vain,\nSpare yourself unavailing pain\nAnd all your love on self bestow;\nA worthy object 'tis, and well\nI know there's none more amiable.

XVII
But from the interview what flowed?\nAlas! It is not hard to guess.\nThe insensate fire of love still glowed\nNor discontinued to distress\nA spirit which for sorrow yearned.\nTattiana more than ever burned\nWith hopeless passion: from her bed\nSweet slumber winged its way and fled.\nHer health, life's sweetness and its bloom,\nHer smile and maidenly repose,\nAll vanished as an echo goes.\nAcross her youth a shade had come,\nAs when the tempest's veil is drawn\nAcross the smiling face of dawn.

XVIII
Alas! Tattiana fades away,\nGrows pale and sinks, but nothing says;\nListless is she the livelong day\nNor interest in aught betrays.\nShaking with serious air the head,\nIn whispers low the neighbours said:\n'Tis time she to the altar went!\nBut enough! Now, 'tis my intent\nThe imagination to enliven\nWith love which happiness extends;\nAgainst my inclination, friends,\nBy sympathy I have been driven.\nForgive me! Such the love I bear\nMy heroine, Tattiana dear.

XIX
Vladimir, hourly more a slave\nTo youthful Olga's beauty bright,\nInto delicious bondage gave\nHis ardent soul with full delight.\nAlways together, eventide\nFound them in darkness side by side,\nAt morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove\nAround the meadow and the grove.\nAnd what resulted? Drunk with love,\nBut with confused and bashful air,\nLenski at intervals would dare,\nIf Olga smilingly approve,\nDally with a dishevelled tress\nOr kiss the border of her dress.

XX
To Olga frequently he would\nSome nice instructive novel read,\nWhose author nature understood\nBetter than Chateaubriand did\nYet sometimes pages two or three\n(Nonsense and pure absurdity,\nFor maiden's hearing deemed unfit),\nHe somewhat blushing would omit:\nFar from the rest the pair would creep\nAnd (elbows on the table) they\nA game of chess would often play,\nBuried in meditation deep,\nTill absently Vladimir took\nWith his own pawn alas! his rook!

XXI
Homeward returning, he at home\nIs occupied with Olga fair,\nAn album, fly-leaf of the tome,\nHe leisurely adorns for her.\nLandscapes thereon he would design,\nA tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,\nOr, with a pen and colours fit,\nA dove which on a lyre doth sit;\nThe "in memoriam” pages sought,\nWhere many another hand had signed\nA tender couplet he combined,\nA register of fleeting thought,\nA flimsy trace of musings past\nWhich might for many ages last.

XXII
Surely ye all have overhauled\nA country damsel's album trim,\nWhich all her darling friends have scrawled\nFrom first to last page to the rim.\nBehold! orthography despising,\nMetreless verses recognizing\nBy friendship how they were abused,\nHewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.\nUpon the opening page ye find:\nQu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?\nSubscribed, "toujours a vous, Annette;”\nAnd on the last one, underlined:\nWho in thy love finds more delight\nBeyond this may attempt to write.

XXIII
Infallibly you there will find\nTwo hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,\nAnd vows will probably be signed:\n"Affectionately yours till death”.\nSome army poet therein may\nHave smuggled his flagitious lay.\nIn such an album with delight\nI would, my friends, inscriptions write,\nBecause I should be sure, meanwhile,\nMy verses, kindly meant, would earn\nDelighted glances in return;\nThat afterwards with evil smile\nThey would not solemnly debate\nIf cleverly or not I prate.

XXIV
But, O ye tomes without compare,\nWhich from the devil's bookcase start,\nAlbums magnificent which scare\nThe fashionable rhymester's heart!\nYea! although rendered beauteous\nBy Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,\nThough Baratynski verses penned,\nThe thunderbolt on you descend!\nWhene'er a brilliant courtly dame\nPresents her quarto amiably,\nDespair and anger seize on me,\nAnd a malicious epigram\nTrembles upon my lips from spite, – \nAnd madrigals I'm asked to write!

XXV
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote\nIn Olga's album, youthful maid,\nTo purest love he tuned his note\nNor frigid adulation paid.\nWhat never was remarked or heard\nOf Olga he in song averred;\nHis elegies, which plenteous streamed,\nBoth natural and truthful seemed.\nThus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise\nIn amorous flights when so inspired,\nSinging God knows what maid admired,\nAnd all thy precious elegies,\nSometime collected, shall relate\nThe story of thy life and fate.

XXVI
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,\nIncited by his stormy Muse\nOdes Lenski also had outpoured,\nBut Olga would not such peruse.\nWhen poets lachrymose recite\nBeneath the eyes of ladies bright\nTheir own productions, some insist\nNo greater pleasure can exist\nJust so! that modest swain is blest\nWho reads his visionary theme\nTo the fair object of his dream,\nA beauty languidly at rest,\nYes, happy – though she at his side\nBy other thoughts be occupied.

XXVII
But I the products of my Muse,\nConsisting of harmonious lays,\nTo my old nurse alone peruse,\nCompanion of my childhood's days.\nOr, after dinner's dull repast,\nI by the button-hole seize fast\nMy neighbour, who by chance drew near,\nAnd breathe a drama in his ear.\nOr else (I deal not here in jokes),\nExhausted by my woes and rhymes,\nI sail upon my lake at times\nAnd terrify a swarm of ducks,\nWho, heard the music of my lay,\nTake to their wings and fly away.

XXVIII
But to Onegin! A propos!\nFriends, I must your indulgence pray.\nHis daily occupations, lo!\nMinutely I will now portray.\nA hermit's life Onegin led,\nAt seven in summer rose from bed,\nAnd clad in airy costume took\nHis course unto the running brook.\nThere, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned\nHis Hellespont from bank to bank,\nAnd then a cup of coffee drank,\nSome wretched journal in his hand;\nThen dressed himself…

XXIX
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,\nThe murmuring brook, the woodland shade,\nThe uncontaminated kiss\nOf a young dark-eyed country maid,\nA fiery, yet well-broken horse,\nA dinner, whimsical each course,\nA bottle of a vintage white\nAnd solitude and calm delight.\nSuch was Onegin's sainted life,\nAnd such unconsciously he led,\nNor marked how summer's prime had fled\nIn aimless ease and far from strife,\nThe curse of commonplace delight.\nAnd town and friends forgotten quite.

XXX
This northern summer of our own,\nOn winters of the south a skit,\nGlimmers and dies. This is well known,\nThough we will not acknowledge it.\nAlready Autumn chilled the sky,\nThe tiny sun shone less on high\nAnd shorter had the days become.\nThe forests in mysterious gloom\nWere stripped with melancholy sound,\nUpon the earth a mist did lie\nAnd many a caravan on high\nOf clamorous geese flew southward bound.\nA weary season was at hand – \nNovember at the gate did stand.

XXXI
The morn arises foggy, cold,\nThe silent fields no peasant nears,\nThe wolf upon the highways bold\nWith his ferocious mate appears.\nDetecting him the passing horse\nsnorts, and his rider bends his course\nAnd wisely gallops to the hill.\nNo more at dawn the shepherd will\nDrive out the cattle from their shed,\nNor at the hour of noon with sound\nOf horn in circle call them round.\nSinging inside her hut the maid\nSpins, whilst the friend of wintry night,\nThe pine-torch, by her crackles bright.

XXXII
Already crisp hoar frosts impose\nO'er all a sheet of silvery dust\n(Readers expect the rhyme of rose,\nThere! take it quickly, if ye must).\nBehold! than polished floor more nice\nThe shining river clothed in ice;\nA joyous troop of little boys\nEngrave the ice with strident noise.\nA heavy goose on scarlet feet,\nThinking to float upon the stream,\nDescends the bank with care extreme,\nBut staggers, slips, and falls. We greet\nThe first bright wreathing storm of snow\nWhich falls in starry flakes below.

XXXIII
How in the country pass this time?\nWalking? The landscape tires the eye\nIn winter by its blank and dim\nAnd naked uniformity.\nOn horseback gallop o'er the steppe!\nYour steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep\nHis footing on the treacherous rime\nAnd may fall headlong any time.\nAlone beneath your rooftree stay\nAnd read De Pradt or Walter Scott!\nKeep your accounts! You'd rather not?\nThen get mad drunk or wroth; the day\nWill pass; the same to-morrow try – \nYou'll spend your winter famously!

XXXIV
A true Childe Harold my Eugene\nTo idle musing was a prey;\nAt morn an icy bath within\nHe sat, and then the livelong day,\nAlone within his habitation\nAnd buried deep in meditation,\nHe round the billiard-table stalked,\nThe balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;\nWhen evening o'er the landscape looms,\nBilliards abandoned, cue forgot,\nA table to the fire is brought,\nAnd he waits dinner. Lenski comes,\nDriving abreast three horses gray.\n"Bring dinner now without delay!”

XXXV
Upon the table in a trice\nOf widow Clicquot or Moet\nA blessed bottle, placed in ice,\nFor the young poet they display.\nLike Hippocrene it scatters light,\nIts ebullition foaming white\n(Like other things I could relate)\nMy heart of old would captivate.\nThe last poor obol I was worth – \nWas it not so? – for thee I gave,\nAnd thy inebriating wave\nFull many a foolish prank brought forth;\nAnd oh! what verses, what delights,\nDelicious visions, jests and fights!

XXXVI
Alas! my stomach it betrays\nWith its exhilarating flow,\nAnd I confess that now-a-days\nI prefer sensible Bordeaux.\nTo cope with Ay no more I dare,\nFor Ay is like a mistress fair,\nSeductive, animated, bright,\nBut wilful, frivolous, and light.\nBut thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend\nWho in the agony of grief\nIs ever ready with relief,\nAssistance ever will extend,\nOr quietly partake our woe.\nAll hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!

XXXVII
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak\nThe golden ember now enshrines,\nAnd barely visible the smoke\nUpward in a thin stream inclines.\nBut little warmth the fireplace lends,\nTobacco smoke the flue ascends,\nThe goblet still is bubbling bright – \nOutside descend the mists of night.\nHow pleasantly the evening jogs\nWhen o'er a glass with friends we prate\nJust at the hour we designate\nThe time between the wolf and dogs – \nI cannot tell on what pretence – \nBut lo! the friends to chat commence.

XXXVIII
"How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,\nTattiana, saucy Olga thine?”\n"The family are all quite well – \nGive me just half a glass of wine – \nThey sent their compliments – but oh!\nHow charming Olga's shoulders grow!\nHer figure perfect grows with time!\nShe is an angel! We sometime\nMust visit them. Come! you must own,\nMy friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,\nFor twice you came to them and yet\nYou never since your nose have shown.\nBut stay! A dolt am I who speak!\nThey have invited you this week.”

XXXIX
"Me?” – "Yes! It is Tattiana's fete\nNext Saturday. The Larina\nTold me to ask you. Ere that date\nMake up your mind to go there.« – »Ah!\nIt will be by a mob beset\nOf every sort and every set!”\n"Not in the least, assured am I!”\n"Who will be there?” – "The family.\nDo me a favour and appear.\nWill you?« – »Agreed.« – »I thank you, friend,”\nAnd saying this Vladimir drained\nHis cup unto his maiden dear.\nThen touching Olga they depart\nIn fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!

XL
He was most gay. The happy date\nIn three weeks would arrive for them;\nThe secrets of the marriage state\nAnd love's delicious diadem\nWith rapturous longing he awaits,\nNor in his dreams anticipates\nHymen's embarrassments, distress,\nAnd freezing fits of weariness.\nThough we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,\nIn life domestic see a string\nOf pictures painful harrowing,\nA novel in Lafontaine's style,\nMy wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,\nHe seemed for matrimony born.

XLI
He was beloved: or say at least,\nHe thought so, and existence charmed.\nThe credulous indeed are blest,\nAnd he who, jealousy disarmed,\nIn sensual sweets his soul doth steep\nAs drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,\nOr, parable more flattering,\nAs butterflies to blossoms cling.\nBut wretched who anticipates,\nWhose brain no fond illusions daze,\nWho every gesture, every phrase\nIn true interpretation hates:\nWhose heart experience icy made\nAnd yet oblivion forbade.

Canto

I
That year the autumn season late\nKept lingering on as loath to go,\nAll Nature winter seemed to await,\nTill January fell no snow – \nThe third at night. Tattiana wakes\nBetimes, and sees, when morning breaks,\nPark, garden, palings, yard below\nAnd roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;\nUpon the windows tracery,\nThe trees in silvery array,\nDown in the courtyard magpies gay,\nAnd the far mountains daintily\nO'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,\nAll so distinct, and all so white!

II
Winter! The peasant blithely goes\nTo labour in his sledge forgot,\nHis pony sniffing the fresh snows\nJust manages a feeble trot\nThough deep he sinks into the drift;\nForth the kibitka gallops swift,\nIts driver seated on the rim\nIn scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;\nYonder the household lad doth run,\nPlaced in a sledge his terrier black,\nHimself transformed into a hack;\nTo freeze his finger hath begun,\nHe laughs, although it aches from cold,\nHis mother from the door doth scold.

III
In scenes like these it may be though,\nYe feel but little interest,\nThey are all natural and low,\nAre not with elegance impressed.\nAnother bard with art divine\nHath pictured in his gorgeous line\nThe first appearance of the snows\nAnd all the joys which Winter knows.\nHe will delight you, I am sure,\nWhen he in ardent verse portrays\nSecret excursions made in sleighs;\nBut competition I abjure\nEither with him or thee in song,\nBard of the Finnish maiden young.

IV
Tattiana, Russian to the core,\nHerself not knowing well the reason,\nThe Russian winter did adore\nAnd the cold beauties of the season:\nOn sunny days the glistening rime,\nSledging, the snows, which at the time\nOf sunset glow with rosy light,\nThe misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.\nThese evenings as in days of old\nThe Larinas would celebrate,\nThe servants used to congregate\nAnd the young ladies fortunes told,\nAnd every year distributed\nJourneys and warriors to wed.

V
Tattiana in traditions old\nBelieved, the people's wisdom weird,\nIn dreams and what the moon foretold\nAnd what she from the cards inferred.\nOmens inspired her soul with fear,\nMysteriously all objects near\nA hidden meaning could impart,\nPresentiments oppressed her heart.\nLo! the prim cat upon the stove\nWith one paw strokes her face and purrs,\nTattiana certainly infers\nThat guests approach: and when above\nThe new moon's crescent slim she spied,\nSuddenly to the left hand side,

VI
She trembled and grew deadly pale.\nOr a swift meteor, may be,\nAcross the gloom of heaven would sail\nAnd disappear in space; then she\nWould haste in agitation dire\nTo mutter her concealed desire\nEre the bright messenger had set.\nWhen in her walks abroad she met\nA friar black approaching near,\nOr a swift hare from mead to mead\nHad run across her path at speed,\nWholly beside herself with fear,\nAnticipating woe she pined,\nCertain misfortune near opined.

VII
Wherefore? She found a secret joy\nIn horror for itself alone,\nThus Nature doth our souls alloy,\nThus her perversity hath shown.\nTwelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!\nWhen thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,\nBefore whose inexperienced sight\nLife lies extended, vast and bright,\nTo peer into the future tries.\nOld age through spectacles too peers,\nAlthough the destined coffin nears,\nHaving lost all in life we prize.\nIt matters not. Hope e'en to these\nWith childlike lisp will lie to please.

VIII
Tattiana gazed with curious eye\nOn melted wax in water poured;\nThe clue unto some mystery\nShe deemed its outline might afford.\nRings from a dish of water full\nIn order due the maidens pull;\nBut when Tattiana's hand had ta'en\nA ring she heard the ancient strain:\nThe peasants there are rich as kings,\nThey shovel silver with a spade,\nHe whom we sing to shall be made\nHappy and glorious. But this brings\nWith sad refrain misfortune near.\nGirls the kashourka much prefer.

IX
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;\nThe wondrous host of heavenly spheres\nSailed silently in unison – \nTattiana in the yard appears\nIn a half-open dressing-gown\nAnd bends her mirror on the moon,\nBut trembling on the mirror dark\nThe sad moon only could remark.\nList! the snow crunches – he draws nigh!\nThe girl on tiptoe forward bounds\nAnd her voice sweeter than the sounds\nOf clarinet or flute doth cry:\n"What is your name?” The boor looked dazed,\nAnd "Agathon” replied, amazed.

X
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)\nBy night prepared for sorcery,\nAnd in the bathroom did command\nTo lay two covers secretly.\nBut sudden fear assailed Tattiana,\nAnd I, remembering Svetlana,\nBecome alarmed. So never mind!\nI'm not for witchcraft now inclined.\nSo she her silken sash unlaced,\nUndressed herself and went to bed\nAnd soon Lel hovered o'er her head.\nBeneath her downy pillow placed,\nA little virgin mirror peeps.\n'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.

XI
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.\nShe dreamt she journeyed o'er a field\nAll covered up with snow in heaps,\nBy melancholy fogs concealed.\nAmid the snowdrifts which surround\nA stream, by winter's ice unbound,\nImpetuously clove its way\nWith boiling torrent dark and gray;\nTwo poles together glued by ice,\nA fragile bridge and insecure,\nSpanned the unbridled torrent o'er;\nBeside the thundering abyss\nTattiana in despair unfeigned\nRooted unto the spot remained.

XII
As if against obstruction sore\nTattiana o'er the stream complained;\nTo help her to the other shore\nNo one appeared to lend a hand.\nBut suddenly a snowdrift stirs,\nAnd what from its recess appears?\nA bristly bear of monstrous size!\nHe roars, and "Ah!” Tattiana cries.\nHe offers her his murderous paw;\nShe nerves herself from her alarm\nAnd leans upon the monster's arm,\nWith footsteps tremulous with awe\nPasses the torrent But alack!\nBruin is marching at her back!

XIII
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,\nAccelerates her hasty pace,\nBut cannot anyhow evade\nHer shaggy myrmidon in chase.\nThe bear rolls on with many a grunt:\nA forest now she sees in front\nWith fir-trees standing motionless\nIn melancholy loveliness,\nTheir branches by the snow bowed down.\nThrough aspens, limes and birches bare,\nThe shining orbs of night appear;\nThere is no path; the storm hath strewn\nBoth bush and brake, ravine and steep,\nAnd all in snow is buried deep.

XIV
The wood she enters – bear behind, – \nIn snow she sinks up to the knee;\nNow a long branch itself entwined\nAround her neck, now violently\nAway her golden earrings tore;\nNow the sweet little shoes she wore,\nGrown clammy, stick fast in the snow;\nHer handkerchief she loses now;\nNo time to pick it up! afraid,\nShe hears the bear behind her press,\nNor dares the skirting of her dress\nFor shame lift up the modest maid.\nShe runs, the bear upon her trail,\nUntil her powers of running fail.

XV
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin\nAdroitly seized and carried her;\nSubmissive as if in a swoon,\nShe cannot draw a breath or stir.\nHe dragged her by a forest road\nTill amid trees a hovel showed,\nBy barren snow heaped up and bound,\nA tangled wilderness around.\nBright blazed the window of the place,\nWithin resounded shriek and shout:\n"My chum lives here,” Bruin grunts out.\n"Warm yourself here a little space!”\nStraight for the entrance then he made\nAnd her upon the threshold laid.

XVI
Recovering, Tania gazes round;\nBear gone – she at the threshold placed;\nInside clink glasses, cries resound\nAs if it were some funeral feast.\nBut deeming all this nonsense pure,\nShe peeped through a chink of the door.\nWhat doth she see? Around the board\nSit many monstrous shapes abhorred.\nA canine face with horns thereon,\nAnother with cock's head appeared,\nHere an old witch with hirsute beard,\nThere an imperious skeleton;\nA dwarf adorned with tail, again\nA shape half cat and half a crane.

XVII
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,\nA crab upon a spider rides,\nPerched on a goose's neck a skull\nIn scarlet cap revolving glides.\nA windmill too a jig performs\nAnd wildly waves its arms and storms;\nBarking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,\nThe speech of man and tramp of horse.\nBut wide Tattiana oped her eyes\nWhen in that company she saw\nHim who inspired both love and awe,\nThe hero we immortalize.\nOnegin sat the table by\nAnd viewed the door with cunning eye.

XVIII
All bustle when he makes a sign:\nHe drinks, all drink and loudly call;\nHe smiles, in laughter all combine;\nHe knits his brows – 'tis silent all.\nHe there is master – that is plain;\nTattiana courage doth regain\nAnd grown more curious by far\nJust placed the entrance door ajar.\nThe wind rose instantly, blew out\nThe fire of the nocturnal lights;\nA trouble fell upon the sprites;\nOnegin lightning glances shot;\nFurious he from the table rose;\nAll arise. To the door he goes.

XIX
Terror assails her. Hastily\nTattiana would attempt to fly,\nShe cannot – then impatiently\nShe strains her throat to force a cry – \nShe cannot – Eugene oped the door\nAnd the young girl appeared before\nThose hellish phantoms. Peals arise\nOf frantic laughter, and all eyes\nAnd hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,\nTails which a bushy tuft adorns,\nWhiskers and bloody tongues and horns,\nSharp rows of tushes, bony claws,\nAre turned upon her. All combine\nIn one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!

XX
"Mine!” cried Eugene with savage tone.\nThe troop of apparitions fled,\nAnd in the frosty night alone\nRemained with him the youthful maid.\nWith tranquil air Onegin leads\nTattiana to a corner, bids\nHer on a shaky bench sit down;\nHis head sinks slowly, rests upon\nHer shoulder – Olga swiftly came – \nAnd Lenski followed – a light broke – \nHis fist Onegin fiercely shook\nAnd gazed around with eyes of flame;\nThe unbidden guests he roughly chides – \nTattiana motionless abides.

XXI
The strife grew furious and Eugene\nGrasped a long knife and instantly\nStruck Lenski dead – across the scene\nDark shadows thicken – a dread cry\nWas uttered, and the cabin shook – \nTattiana terrified awoke.\nShe gazed around her – it was day.\nLo! through the frozen windows play\nAurora's ruddy rays of light – \nThe door flew open – Olga came,\nMore blooming than the Boreal flame\nAnd swifter than the swallow's flight.\n"Come,” she cried, "sister, tell me e'en\nWhom you in slumber may have seen.”

XXII
But she, her sister never heeding,\nWith book in hand reclined in bed,\nPage after page continued reading,\nBut no reply unto her made.\nAlthough her book did not contain\nThe bard's enthusiastic strain,\nNor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,\nYet neither Virgil nor Racine\nNor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,\nNor the Journal des Modes, I vouch,\nEver absorbed a maid so much:\nIts name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,\nThe chief of the Chaldean wise,\nWho dreams expound and prophecies.

XXIII
Brought by a pedlar vagabond\nUnto their solitude one day,\nThis monument of thought profound\nTattiana purchased with a stray\nTome of "Malvina,” and but three\nAnd a half rubles down gave she;\nAlso, to equalise the scales,\nShe got a book of nursery tales,\nA grammar, likewise Petriads two,\nMarmontel also, tome the third;\nTattiana every day conferred\nWith Martin Zadeka. In woe\nShe consolation thence obtained – \nInseparable they remained.

XXIV
The dream left terror in its train.\nNot knowing its interpretation,\nTania the meaning would obtain\nOf such a dread hallucination.\nTattiana to the index flies\nAnd alphabetically tries\nThe words bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,\nRaven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,\nEt cetera; but nothing showed\nHer Martin Zadeka in aid,\nThough the foul vision promise made\nOf a most mournful episode,\nAnd many a day thereafter laid\nA load of care upon the maid.

XXV
"But lo! forth from the valleys dun\nWith purple hand Aurora leads,\nSwift following in her wake, the sun,”\nAnd a grand festival proceeds.\nThe Larinas were since sunrise\nO'erwhelmed with guests; by families\nThe neighbours come, in sledge approach,\nBritzka, kibitka, or in coach.\nCrush and confusion in the hall,\nLatest arrivals' salutations,\nBarking, young ladies' osculations,\nShouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,\nBows and the scrape of many feet,\nNurses who scream and babes who bleat.

XXVI
Bringing his partner corpulent\nFat Poustiakoff drove to the door;\nGvozdine, a landlord excellent,\nOppressor of the wretched poor;\nAnd the Skatenines, aged pair,\nWith all their progeny were there,\nWho from two years to thirty tell;\nPetoushkoff, the provincial swell;\nBouyanoff too, my cousin, wore\nHis wadded coat and cap with peak\n(Surely you know him as I speak);\nAnd Flianoff, pensioned councillor,\nRogue and extortioner of yore,\nNow buffoon, glutton, and a bore.

XXVII
The family of Kharlikoff,\nCame with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,\nWho arrived lately from Tamboff,\nIn spectacles and chestnut wig.\nLike a true Frenchman, couplets wrought\nIn Tania's praise in pouch he brought,\nKnown unto children perfectly:\nReveillez-vouz, belle endormie.\nAmong some ancient ballads thrust,\nHe found them in an almanac,\nAnd the sagacious Triquet back\nTo light had brought them from their dust,\nWhilst he "belle Nina” had the face\nBy "belle Tattiana” to replace.

XXVIII
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,\nOf old maids the divinity,\nAnd comfort of each country dame,\nThe captain of a company.\nHe enters. Ah! good news to-day!\nThe military band will play.\nThe colonel sent it. Oh! delight!\nSo there will be a dance to-night.\nGirls in anticipation skip!\nBut dinner-time comes. Two and two\nThey hand in hand to table go.\nThe maids beside Tattiana keep – \nMen opposite. The cross they sign\nAnd chattering loud sit down to dine.

XXIX
Ceased for a space all chattering.\nJaws are at work. On every side\nPlates, knives and forks are clattering\nAnd ringing wine-glasses are plied.\nBut by degrees the crowd begin\nTo raise a clamour and a din:\nThey laugh, they argue, and they bawl,\nThey shout and no one lists at all.\nThe doors swing open: Lenski makes\nHis entrance with Onegin. "Ah!\nAt last the author!” cries Mamma.\nThe guests make room; aside each takes\nHis chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;\nThe friends are called and quickly placed.

XXX
Right opposite Tattiana placed,\nShe, than the morning moon more pale,\nMore timid than a doe long chased,\nLifts not her eyes which swimming fail.\nAnew the flames of passion start\nWithin her; she is sick at heart;\nThe two friends' compliments she hears\nNot, and a flood of bitter tears\nWith effort she restrains. Well nigh\nThe poor girl fell into a faint,\nBut strength of mind and self-restraint\nPrevailed at last. She in reply\nSaid something in an undertone\nAnd at the table sat her down.

XXXI
To tragedy, the fainting fit,\nAnd female tears hysterical,\nOnegin could not now submit,\nFor long he had endured them all.\nOur misanthrope was full of ire,\nAt a great feast against desire,\nAnd marking Tania's agitation,\nCast down his eyes in trepidation\nAnd sulked in silent indignation;\nSwearing how Lenski he would rile,\nAvenge himself in proper style.\nTriumphant by anticipation,\nCaricatures he now designed\nOf all the guests within his mind.

XXXII
Certainly not Eugene alone\nTattiana's trouble might have spied,\nBut that the eyes of every one\nBy a rich pie were occupied – \nUnhappily too salt by far;\nAnd that a bottle sealed with tar\nAppeared, Don's effervescing boast,\nBetween the blanc-mange and the roast;\nBehind, of glasses an array,\nTall, slender, like thy form designed,\nZizi, thou mirror of my mind,\nFair object of my guileless lay,\nSeductive cup of love, whose flow\nMade me so tipsy long ago!

XXXIII
From the moist cork the bottle freed\nWith loud explosion, the bright wine\nHissed forth. With serious air indeed,\nLong tortured by his lay divine,\nTriquet arose, and for the bard\nThe company deep silence guard.\nTania well nigh expired when he\nTurned to her and discordantly\nIntoned it, manuscript in hand.\nVoices and hands applaud, and she\nMust bow in common courtesy;\nThe poet, modest though so grand,\nDrank to her health in the first place,\nThen handed her the song with grace.

XXXIV
Congratulations, toasts resound,\nTattiana thanks to all returned,\nBut, when Onegin's turn came round,\nThe maiden's weary eye which yearned,\nHer agitation and distress\nAroused in him some tenderness.\nHe bowed to her nor silence broke,\nBut somehow there shone in his look\nThe witching light of sympathy;\nI know not if his heart felt pain\nOr if he meant to flirt again,\nFrom habit or maliciously,\nBut kindness from his eye had beamed\nAnd to revive Tattiana seemed.

XXXV
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,\nThe crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,\nAs bees who leave their dainty store\nAnd seek in buzzing swarms the meads.\nContented and with victuals stored,\nNeighbour by neighbour sat and snored,\nMatrons unto the fireplace go,\nMaids in the corner whisper low;\nBehold! green tables are brought forth,\nAnd testy gamesters do engage\nIn boston and the game of age,\nOmbre, and whist all others worth:\nA strong resemblance these possess – \nAll sons of mental weariness.

XXXVI
Eight rubbers were already played,\nEight times the heroes of the fight\nChange of position had essayed,\nWhen tea was brought. 'Tis my delight\nTime to denote by dinner, tea,\nAnd supper. In the country we\nCan count the time without much fuss – \nThe stomach doth admonish us.\nAnd, by the way, I here assert\nThat for that matter in my verse\nAs many dinners I rehearse,\nAs oft to meat and drink advert,\nAs thou, great Homer, didst of yore,\nWhom thirty centuries adore.

XXXVII
I will with thy divinity\nContend with knife and fork and platter,\nBut grant with magnanimity\nI'm beaten in another matter;\nThy heroes, sanguinary wights,\nAlso thy rough-and-tumble fights,\nThy Venus and thy Jupiter,\nMore advantageously appear\nThan cold Onegin's oddities,\nThe aspect of a landscape drear.\nOr e'en Istomina, my dear,\nAnd fashion's gay frivolities;\nBut my Tattiana, on my soul,\nIs sweeter than thy Helen foul.

XXXVIII
No one the contrary will urge,\nThough for his Helen Menelaus\nAgain a century should scourge\nUs, and like Trojan warriors slay us;\nThough around honoured Priam's throne\nTroy's sages should in concert own\nOnce more, when she appeared in sight,\nParis and Menelaus right.\nBut as to fighting – 'twill appear!\nFor patience, reader, I must plead!\nA little farther please to read\nAnd be not in advance severe.\nThere'll be a fight. I do not lie.\nMy word of honour given have I.

XXXIX
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,\nBut scarce had maids their saucers ta'en\nWhen in the grand saloon was heard\nOf bassoons and of flutes the strain.\nHis soul by crash of music fired,\nHis tea with rum no more desired,\nThe Paris of those country parts\nTo Olga Petoushkova darts:\nTo Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,\nA marriageable maid matured,\nThe poet from Tamboff secured,\nBouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.\nAll to the grand saloon are gone – \nThe ball in all its splendour shone.

XL
I tried when I began this tale,\n(See the first canto if ye will),\nA ball in Peter's capital,\nTo sketch ye in Albano's style.\nBut by fantastic dreams distraught,\nMy memory wandered wide and sought\nThe feet of my dear lady friends.\nO feet, where'er your path extends\nI long enough deceived have erred.\nThe perfidies I recollect\nShould make me much more circumspect,\nReform me both in deed and word,\nAnd this fifth canto ought to be\nFrom such digressions wholly free.

XLI
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,\nUndeviating and insane\nAs giddy youth's hilarity – \nPair after pair the race sustain.\nThe moment for revenge, meanwhile,\nEspying, Eugene with a smile\nApproaches Olga and the pair\nAmid the company career.\nSoon the maid on a chair he seats,\nBegins to talk of this and that,\nBut when two minutes she had sat,\nAgain the giddy waltz repeats.\nAll are amazed; but Lenski he\nScarce credits what his eyes can see.

XLII
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,\nWhen the mazurka used to peal,\nAll rattled in the ball-room vast,\nThe parquet cracked beneath the heel,\nAnd jolting jarred the window-frames.\n'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames\nWe glide along a floor of wax.\nHowever, the mazurka lacks\nNought of its charms original\nIn country towns, where still it keeps\nIts stamping, capers and high leaps.\nFashion is there immutable,\nWho tyrannizes us with ease,\nOf modern Russians the disease.

XLIII
Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,\nUnto the hero of this lay\nOlga and Tania led. Malign,\nOnegin Olga bore away.\nGliding in negligent career,\nHe bending whispered in her ear\nSome madrigal not worth a rush,\nAnd pressed her hand – the crimson blush\nUpon her cheek by adulation\nGrew brighter still. But Lenski hath\nSeen all, beside himself with wrath,\nAnd hot with jealous indignation,\nTill the mazurka's close he stays,\nHer hand for the cotillon prays.

XLIV
She fears she cannot. – Cannot? Why? – \nShe promised Eugene, or she would\nWith great delight. – O God on high!\nHeard he the truth? And thus she could – \nAnd can it be? But late a child\nAnd now a fickle flirt and wild,\nCunning already to display\nAnd well-instructed to betray!\nLenski the stroke could not sustain,\nAt womankind he growled a curse,\nDeparted, ordered out his horse\nAnd galloped home. But pistols twain,\nA pair of bullets – nought beside – \nHis fate shall presently decide.

Canto

I
Having remarked Vladimir's flight,\nOnegin, bored to death again,\nBy Olga stood, dejected quite\nAnd satisfied with vengeance ta'en.\nOlga began to long likewise\nFor Lenski, sought him with her eyes,\nAnd endless the cotillon seemed\nAs if some troubled dream she dreamed.\n'Tis done. To supper they proceed.\nBedding is laid out and to all\nAssigned a lodging, from the hall\nUp to the attic, and all need\nTranquil repose. Eugene alone\nTo pass the night at home hath gone.

II
All slumber. In the drawing-room\nLoud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff\nWith better half as cumbersome;\nGvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petoushkoff\nAnd Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,\nOn chairs in the saloon reposed,\nWhilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet\nIn jersey and in nightcap lay.\nIn Olga's and Tattiana's rooms\nLay all the girls by sleep embraced,\nExcept one by the window placed\nWhom pale Diana's ray illumes – \nMy poor Tattiana cannot sleep\nBut stares into the darkness deep.

III
His visit she had not awaited,\nHis momentary loving glance\nHer inmost soul had penetrated,\nAnd his strange conduct at the dance\nWith Olga; nor of this appeared\nAn explanation: she was scared,\nAlarmed by jealous agonies:\nA hand of ice appeared to seize\nHer heart: it seemed a darksome pit\nBeneath her roaring opened wide:\n"I shall expire,” Tattiana cried,\n"But death from him will be delight.\nI murmur not! Why mournfulness?\nHe cannot give me happiness.”

IV
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!\nA new acquaintance we must scan.\nThere dwells five versts from Krasnogory,\nVladimir's property, a man\nWho thrives this moment as I write,\nA philosophic anchorite:\nZaretski, once a bully bold,\nA gambling troop when he controlled,\nChief rascal, pot-house president,\nNow of a family the head,\nSimple and kindly and unwed,\nTrue friend, landlord benevolent,\nYea! and a man of honour, lo!\nHow perfect doth our epoch grow!

V
Time was the flattering voice of fame,\nHis ruffian bravery adored,\nAnd true, his pistol's faultless aim\nAn ace at fifteen paces bored.\nBut I must add to what I write\nThat, tipsy once in actual fight,\nHe from his Kalmuck horse did leap\nIn mud and mire to wallow deep,\nDrunk as a fly; and thus the French\nA valuable hostage gained,\nA modern Regulus unchained,\nWho to surrender did not blench\nThat every morn at Verrey's cost\nThree flasks of wine he might exhaust.

VI
Time was, his raillery was gay,\nHe loved the simpleton to mock,\nTo make wise men the idiot play\nOpenly or 'neath decent cloak.\nYet sometimes this or that deceit\nEncountered punishment complete,\nAnd sometimes into snares as well\nHimself just like a greenhorn fell.\nHe could in disputation shine\nWith pungent or obtuse retort,\nAt times to silence would resort,\nAt times talk nonsense with design;\nQuarrels among young friends he bred\nAnd to the field of honour led;

VII
Or reconciled them, it may be,\nAnd all the three to breakfast went;\nThen he'd malign them secretly\nWith jest and gossip gaily blent.\nSed alia tempora. And bravery\n(Like love, another sort of knavery!)\nDiminishes as years decline.\nBut, as I said, Zaretski mine\nBeneath acacias, cherry-trees,\nFrom storms protection having sought,\nLived as a really wise man ought,\nLike Horace, planted cabbages,\nBoth ducks and geese in plenty bred\nAnd lessons to his children read.

VIII
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,\nTo friendship making no pretence,\nAdmired his judgment, which was fine,\nPervaded with much common sense.\nHe usually was glad to see\nThe man and liked his company,\nSo, when he came next day to call,\nWas not surprised thereby at all.\nBut, after mutual compliments,\nZaretski with a knowing grin,\nEre conversation could begin,\nThe epistle from the bard presents.\nOnegin to the window went\nAnd scanned in silence its content.

IX
It was a cheery, generous\nCartel, or challenge to a fight,\nWhereto in language courteous\nLenski his comrade did invite.\nOnegin, by first impulse moved,\nTurned and replied as it behoved,\nCurtly announcing for the fray\nThat he was "ready any day.”\nZaretski rose, nor would explain,\nHe cared no longer there to stay,\nHad much to do at home that day,\nAnd so departed. But Eugene,\nThe matter by his conscience tried,\nWas with himself dissatisfied.

X
In fact, the subject analysed,\nWithin that secret court discussed,\nIn much his conduct stigmatized;\nFor, from the outset, 'twas unjust\nTo jest as he had done last eve,\nA timid, shrinking love to grieve.\nAnd ought he not to disregard\nThe poet's madness? for 'tis hard\nAt eighteen not to play the fool!\nSincerely loving him, Eugene\nAssuredly should not have been\nConventionality's dull tool – \nNot a mere hot, pugnacious boy,\nBut man of sense and probity.

XI
He might his motives have narrated,\nNot bristled up like a wild beast,\nHe ought to have conciliated\nThat youthful heart – "But, now at least,\nThe opportunity is flown.\nBesides, a duellist well-known\nHath mixed himself in the affair,\nMalicious and a slanderer.\nUndoubtedly, disdain alone\nShould recompense his idle jeers,\nBut fools – their calumnies and sneers” – \nBehold! the world's opinion!\nOur idol, Honour's motive force,\nRound which revolves the universe.

XII
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,\nThe bard his answer waits at home,\nBut lo! his braggart neighbour hath\nTriumphant with the answer come.\nNow for the jealous youth what joy!\nHe feared the criminal might try\nTo treat the matter as a jest,\nUse subterfuge, and thus his breast\nFrom the dread pistol turn away.\nBut now all doubt was set aside,\nUnto the windmill he must ride\nTo-morrow before break of day,\nTo cock the pistol; barrel bend\nOn thigh or temple, friend on friend.

XIII
Resolved the flirt to cast away,\nThe foaming Lenski would refuse,\nTo see his Olga ere the fray – \nHis watch, the sun in turn he views – \nFinally tost his arms in air\nAnd lo! he is already there!\nHe deemed his coming would inspire\nOlga with trepidation dire.\nHe was deceived. Just as before\nThe miserable bard to meet,\nAs hope uncertain and as sweet,\nOlga ran skipping from the door.\nShe was as heedless and as gay – \nWell! just as she was yesterday.

XIV
"Why did you leave last night so soon?”\nWas the first question Olga made,\nLenski, into confusion thrown,\nAll silently hung down his head.\nJealousy and vexation took\nTo flight before her radiant look,\nBefore such fond simplicity\nAnd mental elasticity.\nHe eyed her with a fond concern,\nPerceived that he was still beloved,\nAlready by repentance moved\nTo ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;\nBut trembles, words he cannot find,\nDelighted, almost sane in mind.

XV
But once more pensive and distressed\nBeside his Olga doth he grieve,\nNor enough strength of mind possessed\nTo mention the foregoing eve,\nHe mused: "I will her saviour be!\nWith ardent sighs and flattery\nThe vile seducer shall not dare\nThe freshness of her heart impair,\nNor shall the caterpillar come\nThe lily's stem to eat away,\nNor shall the bud of yesterday\nPerish when half disclosed its bloom!” – \nAll this, my friends, translate aright:\n"I with my friend intend to fight!”

XVI
If he had only known the wound\nWhich rankled in Tattiana's breast,\nAnd if Tattiana mine had found – \nIf the poor maiden could have guessed\nThat the two friends with morning's light\nAbove the yawning grave would fight, – \nAh! it may be, affection true\nHad reconciled the pair anew!\nBut of this love, e'en casually,\nAs yet none had discovered aught;\nEugene of course related nought,\nTattiana suffered secretly;\nHer nurse, who could have made a guess,\nWas famous for thick-headedness.

XVII
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,\nNow gloomy seemed and cheerful now,\nBut he who by the Muse was nursed\nIs ever thus. With frowning brow\nTo the pianoforte he moves\nAnd various chords upon it proves,\nThen, eyeing Olga, whispers low:\n"I'm happy, say, is it not so?” – \nBut it grew late; he must not stay;\nHeavy his heart with anguish grew;\nTo the young girl he said adieu,\nAs it were, tore himself away.\nGazing into his face, she said:\n"What ails thee?” – "Nothing.” – He is fled.

XVIII
At home arriving he addressed\nHis care unto his pistols' plight,\nReplaced them in their box, undressed\nAnd Schiller read by candlelight.\nBut one thought only filled his mind,\nHis mournful heart no peace could find,\nOlga he sees before his eyes\nMiraculously fair arise,\nVladimir closes up his book,\nAnd grasps a pen: his verse, albeit\nWith lovers' rubbish filled, was neat\nAnd flowed harmoniously. He took\nAnd spouted it with lyric fire – \nLike D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.

XIX
Destiny hath preserved his lay.\nI have it. Lo! the very thing!\n"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,\nYe golden days of my young spring?\nWhat will the coming dawn reveal?\nIn vain my anxious eyes appeal;\nIn mist profound all yet is hid.\nSo be it! Just the laws which bid\nThe fatal bullet penetrate,\nOr innocently past me fly.\nGood governs all! The hour draws nigh\nOf life or death predestinate.\nBlest be the labours of the light,\nAnd blest the shadows of the night.

XX
”To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,\nBright day will then begin to burn,\nBut the dark sepulchre I may\nHave entered never to return.\nThe memory of the bard, a dream,\nWill be absorbed by Lethe's stream;\nMen will forget me, but my urn\nTo visit, lovely maid, return,\nO'er my remains to drop a tear,\nAnd think: here lies who loved me well,\nFor consecrate to me he fell\nIn the dawn of existence drear.\nMaid whom my heart desires alone,\nApproach, approach; I am thine own."

XXI
Thus in a style obscure and stale,\nHe wrote ('tis the romantic style,\nThough of romance therein I fail\nTo see aught – never mind meanwhile)\nAnd about dawn upon his breast\nHis weary head declined at rest,\nFor o'er a word to fashion known,\n"Ideal,” he had drowsy grown.\nBut scarce had sleep's soft witchery\nSubdued him, when his neighbour stept\nInto the chamber where he slept\nAnd wakened him with the loud cry:\n”'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.\nOnegin waits on us, 'tis like.«

XXII
He was in error; for Eugene\nWas sleeping then a sleep like death;\nThe pall of night was growing thin,\nTo Lucifer the cock must breathe\nHis song, when still he slumbered deep,\nThe sun had mounted high his steep,\nA passing snowstorm wreathed away\nWith pallid light, but Eugene lay\nUpon his couch insensibly;\nSlumber still o'er him lingering flies.\nBut finally he oped his eyes\nAnd turned aside the drapery;\nHe gazed upon the clock which showed\nHe long should have been on the road.

XXIII
He rings in haste; in haste arrives\nHis Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,\nWho dressing-gown and slippers gives\nAnd linen on him doth bestow.\nDressing as quickly as he can,\nEugene directs the trusty man\nTo accompany him and to escort\nA box of terrible import.\nHarnessed the rapid sledge arrived:\nHe enters: to the mill he drives:\nDescends, the order Guillot gives,\nThe fatal tubes Lepage contrived\nTo bring behind: the triple steeds\nTo two young oaks the coachman leads.

XXIV
Lenski the foeman's apparition\nLeaning against the dam expects,\nZaretski, village mechanician,\nIn the meantime the mill inspects.\nOnegin his excuses says;\n"But,” cried Zaretski in amaze,\n"Your second you have left behind!”\nA duellist of classic mind,\nMethod was dear unto his heart\nHe would not that a man ye slay\nIn a lax or informal way,\nBut followed the strict rules of art,\nAnd ancient usages observed\n(For which our praise he hath deserved).

XXV
"My second!” cried in turn Eugene,\n"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;\nTo this arrangement can be seen,\nNo obstacle of which I know.\nAlthough unknown to fame mayhap,\nHe's a straightforward little chap.”\nZaretski bit his lip in wrath,\nBut to Vladimir Eugene saith:\n"Shall we commence?” – "Let it be so,”\nLenski replied, and soon they be\nBehind the mill. Meantime ye see\nZaretski and Monsieur Guillot\nIn consultation stand aside – \nThe foes with downcast eyes abide.

XXVI
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent\nAsunder was and hate prepared?\nSince leisure was together spent,\nMeals, secrets, occupations shared?\nNow, like hereditary foes,\nMalignant fury they disclose,\nAs in some frenzied dream of fear\nThese friends cold-bloodedly draw near\nMutual destruction to contrive.\nCannot they amicably smile\nEre crimson stains their hands defile,\nDepart in peace and friendly live?\nBut fashionable hatred's flame\nTrembles at artificial shame.

XXVII
The shining pistols are uncased,\nThe mallet loud the ramrod strikes,\nBullets are down the barrels pressed,\nFor the first time the hammer clicks.\nLo! poured in a thin gray cascade,\nThe powder in the pan is laid,\nThe sharp flint, screwed securely on,\nIs cocked once more. Uneasy grown,\nGuillot behind a pollard stood;\nAside the foes their mantles threw,\nZaretski paces thirty-two\nMeasured with great exactitude.\nAt each extreme one takes his stand,\nA loaded pistol in his hand.

XXVIII
"Advance!” – \nIndifferent and sedate,\nThe foes, as yet not taking aim,\nWith measured step and even gait\nAthwart the snow four paces came – \nFour deadly paces do they span;\nOnegin slowly then began\nTo raise his pistol to his eye,\nThough he advanced unceasingly.\nAnd lo! five paces more they pass,\nAnd Lenski, closing his left eye,\nTook aim – but as immediately\nOnegin fired – Alas! alas!\nThe poet's hour hath sounded – See!\nHe drops his pistol silently.

XXIX
He on his bosom gently placed\nHis hand, and fell. His clouded eye\nNot agony, but death expressed.\nSo from the mountain lazily\nThe avalanche of snow first bends,\nThen glittering in the sun descends.\nThe cold sweat bursting from his brow,\nTo the youth Eugene hurried now – \nGazed on him, called him. Useless care!\nHe was no more! The youthful bard\nFor evermore had disappeared.\nThe storm was hushed. The blossom fair\nWas withered ere the morning light – \nThe altar flame was quenched in night.

XXX
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view\nThe peace which on his forehead beamed,\nHis breast was riddled through and through,\nThe blood gushed from the wound and steamed\nEre this but one brief moment beat\nThat heart with inspiration sweet\nAnd enmity and hope and love – \nThe blood boiled and the passions strove.\nNow, as in a deserted house,\nAll dark and silent hath become;\nThe inmate is for ever dumb,\nThe windows whitened, shutters close – \nWhither departed is the host?\nGod knows! The very trace is lost.

XXXI
'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate\nWith epigrams impertinent,\nSweet to behold him obstinate,\nHis butting horns in anger bent,\nThe glass unwittingly inspect\nAnd blush to own himself reflect.\nSweeter it is, my friends, if he\nHowl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!\nBut sweeter still it is to arrange\nFor him an honourable grave,\nAt his pale brow a shot to have,\nPlaced at the customary range;\nBut home his body to despatch\nCan scarce in sweetness be a match.

XXXII
Well, if your pistol ball by chance\nThe comrade of your youth should strike,\nWho by a haughty word or glance\nOr any trifle else ye like\nYou o'er your wine insulted hath – \nOr even overcome by wrath\nScornfully challenged you afield – \nTell me, of sentiments concealed\nWhich in your spirit dominates,\nWhen motionless your gaze beneath\nHe lies, upon his forehead death,\nAnd slowly life coagulates – \nWhen deaf and silent he doth lie\nHeedless of your despairing cry?

XXXIII
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand\nAnd with remorseful anguish filled,\nGazing on Lenski's corse did stand – \nZaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!” – \nKilled! at this dreadful exclamation\nOnegin went with trepidation\nAnd the attendants called in haste.\nMost carefully Zaretski placed\nWithin his sledge the stiffened corse,\nAnd hurried home his awful freight.\nConscious of death approximate,\nLoud paws the earth each panting horse,\nHis bit with foam besprinkled o'er,\nAnd homeward like an arrow tore.

XXXIV
My friends, the poet ye regret!\nWhen hope's delightful flower but bloomed\nIn bud of promise incomplete,\nThe manly toga scarce assumed,\nHe perished. Where his troubled dreams,\nAnd where the admirable streams\nOf youthful impulse, reverie,\nTender and elevated, free?\nAnd where tempestuous love's desires,\nThe thirst of knowledge and of fame,\nHorror of sinfulness and shame,\nImagination's sacred fires,\nYe shadows of a life more high,\nYe dreams of heavenly poesy?

XXXV
Perchance to benefit mankind,\nOr but for fame he saw the light;\nHis lyre, to silence now consigned,\nResounding through all ages might\nHave echoed to eternity.\nWith worldly honours, it may be,\nFortune the poet had repaid.\nIt may be that his martyred shade\nCarried a truth divine away;\nThat, for the century designed,\nHad perished a creative mind,\nAnd past the threshold of decay,\nHe ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,\nThe blessings of humanity.

XXXVI
Or, it may be, the bard had passed\nA life in common with the rest;\nVanished his youthful years at last,\nThe fire extinguished in his breast,\nIn many things had changed his life – \nThe Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,\nInhabited the country, clad\nIn dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:\nA life of fact, not fiction, led – \nAt forty suffered from the gout,\nEaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:\nAnd finally, upon his bed\nHad finished life amid his sons,\nDoctors and women, sobs and groans.

XXXVII
But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,\nAlas! the youthful lover slain,\nPoetical enthusiast,\nA friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!\nThere is a spot the village near\nWhere dwelt the Muses' worshipper,\nTwo pines have joined their tangled roots,\nA rivulet beneath them shoots\nIts waters to the neighbouring vale.\nThere the tired ploughman loves to lie,\nThe reaping girls approach and ply\nWithin its wave the sounding pail,\nAnd by that shady rivulet\nA simple tombstone hath been set.

XXXVIII
There, when the rains of spring we mark\nUpon the meadows showering,\nThe shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,\nOf Volga fishermen doth sing,\nAnd the young damsel from the town,\nFor summer to the country flown,\nWhene'er across the plain at speed\nAlone she gallops on her steed,\nStops at the tomb in passing by;\nThe tightened leathern rein she draws,\nAside she casts her veil of gauze\nAnd reads with rapid eager eye\nThe simple epitaph – a tear\nDoth in her gentle eye appear.

XXXIX
And meditative from the spot\nShe leisurely away doth ride,\nSpite of herself with Lenski's lot\nLongtime her mind is occupied.\nShe muses: ”What was Olga's fate?\nLongtime was her heart desolate\nOr did her tears soon cease to flow?\nAnd where may be her sister now?\nWhere is the outlaw, banned by men,\nOf fashionable dames the foe,\nThe misanthrope of gloomy brow,\nBy whom the youthful bard was slain?" – \nIn time I'll give ye without fail\nA true account and in detail.

XL
But not at present, though sincerely\nI on my chosen hero dote;\nThough I'll return to him right early,\nJust at this moment I cannot.\nYears have inclined me to stern prose,\nYears to light rhyme themselves oppose,\nAnd now, I mournfully confess,\nIn rhyming I show laziness.\nAs once, to fill the rapid page\nMy pen no longer finds delight,\nOther and colder thoughts affright,\nSterner solicitudes engage,\nIn worldly din or solitude\nUpon my visions such intrude.

XLI
Fresh aspirations I have known,\nI am acquainted with fresh care,\nHopeless are all the first, I own,\nYet still remains the old despair.\nIllusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?\nWhere youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?\nAnd is it true her garland bright\nAt last is shrunk and withered quite?\nAnd is it true and not a jest,\nNot even a poetic phrase,\nThat vanished are my youthful days\n(This joking I used to protest),\nNever for me to reappear – \nThat soon I reach my thirtieth year?

XLII
And so my noon hath come! If so,\nI must resign myself, in sooth;\nYet let us part in friendship, O\nMy frivolous and jolly youth.\nI thank thee for thy joyfulness,\nLove's tender transports and distress,\nFor riot, frolics, mighty feeds,\nAnd all that from thy hand proceeds – \nI thank thee. In thy company,\nWith tumult or contentment still\nOf thy delights I drank my fill,\nEnough! with tranquil spirit I\nCommence a new career in life\nAnd rest from bygone days of strife.

XLIII
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,\nWhere my days in the wilderness\nOf languor and of love did tell\nAnd contemplative dreaminess;\nAnd thou, youth's early inspiration,\nInvigorate imagination\nAnd spur my spirit's torpid mood!\nFly frequent to my solitude,\nLet not the poet's spirit freeze,\nGrow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,\nEventually petrify\nIn the world's mortal revelries,\nAmid the soulless sons of pride\nAnd glittering simpletons beside;

XLIV
Amid sly, pusillanimous\nSpoiled children most degenerate\nAnd tiresome rogues ridiculous\nAnd stupid censors passionate;\nAmid coquettes who pray to God\nAnd abject slaves who kiss the rod;\nIn haunts of fashion where each day\nAll with urbanity betray,\nWhere harsh frivolity proclaims\nIts cold unfeeling sentences;\nAmid the awful emptiness\nOf conversation, thought and aims – \nIn that morass where you and I\nWallow, my friends, in company!

Canto

I
Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,\nThe snows from off the hills around\nDescended swift in turbid streams\nAnd flooded all the level ground.\nA smile from slumbering nature clear\nDid seem to greet the youthful year;\nThe heavens shone in deeper blue,\nThe woods, still naked to the view,\nSeemed in a haze of green embowered.\nThe bee forth from his cell of wax\nFlew to collect his rural tax;\nThe valleys dried and gaily flowered;\nHerds low, and under night's dark veil\nAlready sings the nightingale.

II
Mournful is thine approach to me,\nO Spring, thou chosen time of love!\nWhat agitation languidly\nMy spirit and my blood doth move,\nWhat sad emotions o'er me steal\nWhen first upon my cheek I feel\nThe breath of Spring again renewed,\nSecure in rural quietude – \nOr, strange to me is happiness?\nDo all things which to mirth incline.\nAnd make a dark existence shine\nInflict annoyance and distress\nUpon a soul inert and cloyed? – \nAnd is all light within destroyed?

III
Or, heedless of the leaves' return\nWhich Autumn late to earth consigned,\nDo we alone our losses mourn\nOf which the rustling woods remind?\nOr, when anew all Nature teems,\nDo we foresee in troubled dreams\nThe coming of life's Autumn drear.\nFor which no springtime shall appear?\nOr, it may be, we inly seek,\nWafted upon poetic wing,\nSome other long-departed Spring,\nWhose memories make the heart beat quick\nWith thoughts of a far distant land,\nOf a strange night when the moon and –

IV
'Tis now the season! Idlers all,\nEpicurean philosophers,\nYe men of fashion cynical,\nOf Levshin's school ye followers,\nPriams of country populations\nAnd dames of fine organisations,\nSpring summons you to her green bowers,\n'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;\nThe time for mystic strolls which late\nInto the starry night extend.\nQuick to the country let us wend\nIn vehicles surcharged with freight;\nIn coach or post-cart duly placed\nBeyond the city-barriers haste.

V
Thou also, reader generous,\nThe chaise long ordered please employ,\nAbandon cities riotous,\nWhich in the winter were a joy:\nThe Muse capricious let us coax,\nGo hear the rustling of the oaks\nBeside a nameless rivulet,\nWhere in the country Eugene yet,\nAn idle anchorite and sad,\nA while ago the winter spent,\nNear young Tattiana resident,\nMy pretty self-deceiving maid – \nNo more the village knows his face,\nFor there he left a mournful trace.

VI
Let us proceed unto a rill,\nWhich in a hilly neighbourhood\nSeeks, winding amid meadows still,\nThe river through the linden wood.\nThe nightingale there all night long,\nSpring's paramour, pours forth her song\nThe fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,\nAnd lo! where lies a marble tomb\nAnd two old pines their branches spread – \n"Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,\nWho early died a gallant death”,\nThereon the passing traveller read:\n"The date, his fleeting years how long – \nRepose in peace, thou child of song”.

VII
Time was, the breath of early dawn\nWould agitate a mystic wreath\nHung on a pine branch earthward drawn\nAbove the humble urn of death.\nTime was, two maidens from their home\nAt eventide would hither come,\nAnd, by the light the moonbeams gave,\nLament, embrace upon that grave.\nBut now – none heeds the monument\nOf woe: effaced the pathway now:\nThere is no wreath upon the bough:\nAlone beside it, gray and bent,\nAs formerly the shepherd sits\nAnd his poor basten sandal knits.

VIII
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears\nThee but a little space bewept,\nFaithless, alas! thy maid appears,\nNor true unto her sorrow kept.\nAnother could her heart engage,\nAnother could her woe assuage\nBy flattery and lover's art – \nA lancer captivates her heart!\nA lancer her soul dotes upon:\nBefore the altar, lo! the pair,\nMark ye with what a modest air\nShe bows her head beneath the crown;\nBehold her downcast eyes which glow,\nHer lips where light smiles come and go!

IX
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,\nPassed into dull eternity,\nWas the sad poet filled with gloom,\nHearing the fatal perfidy?\nOr, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,\nHath the bard, by indifference blest,\nCallous to all on earth become – \nIs the world to him sealed and dumb?\nThe same unmoved oblivion\nOn us beyond the grave attends,\nThe voice of lovers, foes and friends,\nDies suddenly: of heirs alone\nRemains on earth the unseemly rage,\nWhilst struggling for the heritage.

X
Soon Olga's accents shrill resound\nNo longer through her former home;\nThe lancer, to his calling bound,\nBack to his regiment must roam.\nThe aged mother, bathed in tears,\nDistracted by her grief appears\nWhen the hour came to bid good-bye – \nBut my Tattiana's eyes were dry.\nOnly her countenance assumed\nA deadly pallor, air distressed;\nWhen all around the entrance pressed,\nTo say farewell, and fussed and fumed\nAround the carriage of the pair – \nTattiana gently led them there.

XI
And long her eyes as through a haze\nAfter the wedded couple strain;\nAlas! the friend of childish days\nAway, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.\nThy dove, thy darling little pet\nOn whom a sister's heart was set\nAfar is borne by cruel fate,\nFor evermore is separate.\nShe wanders aimless as a sprite,\nInto the tangled garden goes\nBut nowhere can she find repose,\nNor even tears afford respite,\nOf consolation all bereft – \nWell nigh her heart in twain was cleft.

XII
In cruel solitude each day\nWith flame more ardent passion burns,\nAnd to Onegin far away\nHer heart importunately turns.\nShe never more his face may view,\nFor was it not her duty to\nDetest him for a brother slain?\nThe poet fell; already men\nNo more remembered him; unto\nAnother his betrothed was given;\nThe memory of the bard was driven\nLike smoke athwart the heaven blue;\nTwo hearts perchance were desolate\nAnd mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?

XIII
'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds\nIn tranquil flow. The beetle hums.\nAlready dance to song proceeds;\nThe fisher's fire afar illumes\nThe river's bank. Tattiana lone\nBeneath the silver of the moon\nLong time in meditation deep\nHer path across the plain doth keep – \nProceeds, until she from a hill\nSees where a noble mansion stood,\nA village and beneath, a wood,\nA garden by a shining rill.\nShe gazed thereon, and instant beat\nHer heart more loudly and more fleet.

XIV
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown – \n"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?\nHe is not there: I am not known:\nThe house and garden I would see.”\nTattiana from the hill descends\nWith bated breath, around she bends\nA countenance perplexed and scared.\nShe enters a deserted yard – \nYelping, a pack of dogs rush out,\nBut at her shriek ran forth with noise\nThe household troop of little boys,\nWho with a scuffle and a shout\nThe curs away to kennel chase,\nThe damsel under escort place.

XV
"Can I inspect the mansion, please?”\nTattiana asks, and hurriedly\nUnto Anicia for the keys\nThe family of children hie.\nAnicia soon appears, the door\nOpens unto her visitor.\nInto the lonely house she went,\nWherein a space Onegin spent.\nShe gazed – a cue, forgotten long,\nDoth on the billiard table rest,\nUpon the tumbled sofa placed,\nA riding whip. She strolls along.\nThe beldam saith: "The hearth, by it\nThe master always used to sit.

XVI
"Departed Lenski here to dine\nIn winter time would often come.\nPlease follow this way, lady mine,\nThis is my master's sitting-room.\n'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,\nInto accounts would sometimes look,\nA book at early morn perused.\nThe room my former master used.\nOn Sundays by yon window he,\nSpectacles upon nose, all day\nWas wont with me at cards to play.\nGod save his soul eternally\nAnd grant his weary bones their rest\nDeep in our mother Earth's chill breast!"

XVII
Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam\nOn everything around her gaze,\nOf priceless value all things seem\nAnd in her languid bosom raise\nA pleasure though with sorrow knit:\nThe table with its lamp unlit,\nThe pile of books, with carpet spread\nBeneath the window-sill his bed,\nThe landscape which the moonbeams fret,\nThe twilight pale which softens all,\nLord Byron's portrait on the wall\nAnd the cast-iron statuette\nWith folded arms and eyes bent low,\nCocked hat and melancholy brow.

XVIII
Long in this fashionable cell\nTattiana as enchanted stood;\nBut it grew late; cold blew the gale;\nDark was the valley and the wood\nslept o'er the river misty grown.\nBehind the mountain sank the moon.\nLong, long the hour had past when home\nOur youthful wanderer should roam.\nShe hid the trouble of her breast,\nHeaved an involuntary sigh\nAnd turned to leave immediately,\nBut first permission did request\nThither in future to proceed\nThat certain volumes she might read.

XIX
Adieu she to the matron said\nAt the front gates, but in brief space\nAt early morn returns the maid\nTo the abandoned dwelling-place.\nWhen in the study's calm retreat,\nWrapt in oblivion complete,\nShe found herself alone at last,\nLongtime her tears flowed thick and fast;\nBut presently she tried to read;\nAt first for books was disinclined,\nBut soon their choice seemed to her mind\nRemarkable. She then indeed\nDevoured them with an eager zest.\nA new world was made manifest!

XX
Although we know that Eugene had\nLong ceased to be a reading man,\nStill certain authors, I may add,\nHe had excepted from the ban:\nThe bard of Juan and the Giaour,\nWith it may be a couple more;\nRomances three, in which ye scan\nPortrayed contemporary man\nAs the reflection of his age,\nHis immorality of mind\nTo arid selfishness resigned,\nA visionary personage\nWith his exasperated sense,\nHis energy and impotence.

XXI
And numerous pages had preserved\nThe sharp incisions of his nail,\nAnd these the attentive maid observed\nWith eye precise and without fail.\nTattiana saw with trepidation\nBy what idea or observation\nOnegin was the most impressed,\nIn what he merely acquiesced.\nUpon those margins she perceived\nOnegin's pencillings. His mind\nMade revelations undesigned,\nOf what he thought and what believed,\nA dagger, asterisk, or note\nInterrogation to denote.

XXII
And my Tattiana now began\nTo understand by slow degrees\nMore clearly, God be praised, the man,\nWhom autocratic fate's decrees\nHad bid her sigh for without hope – \nA dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,\nBeing from hell or heaven sent,\nAngel or fiend malevolent.\nWhich is he? or an imitation,\nA bogy conjured up in joke,\nA Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,\nOf foreign whims the impersonation – \nHandbook of fashionable phrase\nOr parody of modern ways?

XXIII
Hath she found out the riddle yet?\nHath she a fitting phrase selected?\nBut time flies and she doth forget\nThey long at home have her expected – \nWhither two neighbouring dames have walked\nAnd a long time about her talked.\n"What can be done? She is no child!”\nCried the old dame with anguish filled:\n”Olinka is her junior, see.\n'Tis time to many her, 'tis true,\nBut tell me what am I to do?\nTo all she answers cruelly – \nI will not wed, and ever weeps\nAnd lonely through the forest creeps."

XXIV
"Is she in love?” quoth one. ”With whom?\nBouyanoff courted. She refused.\nPetoushkoff met the selfsame doom.\nThe hussar Pikhtin was accused.\nHow the young imp on Tania doted!\nTo captivate her how devoted!\nI mused: perhaps the matter's squared – \nO yes! my hopes soon disappeared.”\n"But, matushka, to Moscow you\nShould go, the market for a maid,\nWith many a vacancy, 'tis said.« – \n"Alas! my friend, no revenue!”\n»Enough to see one winter's end;\nIf not, the money I will lend.«

XXV
The venerable dame opined\nThe counsel good and full of reason,\nHer money counted, and designed\nTo visit Moscow in the season.\nTattiana learns the intelligence – \nOf her provincial innocence\nThe unaffected traits she now\nUnto a carping world must show – \nHer toilette's antiquated style,\nHer antiquated mode of speech,\nFor Moscow fops and Circes each\nTo mark with a contemptuous smile.\nHorror! had she not better stay\nDeep in the greenwood far away?

XXVI
Arising with the morning's light,\nUnto the fields she makes her way,\nAnd with emotional delight\nSurveying them, she thus doth say:\n»Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!\nYe well-known mountain summits high,\nYe groves whose depths I know so well,\nThou beauteous sky above, farewell!\nDelicious nature, thee I fly,\nThe calm existence which I prize\nI yield for splendid vanities,\nThou too farewell, my liberty!\nWhither and wherefore do I speed\nAnd what will Destiny concede?"

XXVII
Farther Tattiana's walks extend – \n'Tis now the hillock now the rill\nTheir natural attractions lend\nTo stay the maid against her will.\nShe the acquaintances she loves,\nHer spacious fields and shady groves,\nAnother visit hastes to pay.\nBut Summer swiftly fades away\nAnd golden Autumn draweth nigh,\nAnd pallid nature trembling grieves,\nA victim decked with golden leaves;\nDark clouds before the north wind fly;\nIt blew: it howled: till winter e'en\nCame forth in all her magic sheen.

XXVIII
The snow descends and buries all,\nHangs heavy on the oaken boughs,\nA white and undulating pall\nO'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.\nThe channel of the river stilled\nAs if with eider-down is filled.\nThe hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice\nIn mother Winter's strange caprice.\nBut Tania's heart is not at ease,\nWinter's approach she doth not hail\nNor the frost particles inhale\nNor the first snow of winter seize\nHer shoulders, breast and face to lave – \nAlarm the winter journey gave.

XXIX
The date was fixed though oft postponed,\nBut ultimately doth approach.\nExamined, mended, newly found\nWas the old and forgotten coach;\nKibitkas three, the accustomed train,\nThe household property contain:\nSaucepans and mattresses and chairs,\nPortmanteaus and preserves in jars,\nFeather-beds, also poultry-coops,\nBasins and jugs – well! everything\nTo happiness contributing.\nBehold! beside their dwelling groups\nOf serfs the farewell wail have given.\nNags eighteen to the door are driven.

XXX
These to the coach of state are bound,\nBreakfast the busy cooks prepare,\nBaggage is heaped up in a mound,\nOld women at the coachmen swear.\nA bearded postillion astride\nA lean and shaggy nag doth ride,\nUnto the gates the servants fly\nTo bid the gentlefolk good-bye.\nThese take their seats; the coach of state\nLeisurely through the gateway glides.\n”Adieu! thou home where peace abides,\nWhere turmoil cannot penetrate,\nShall I behold thee once again?« – \nTattiana tears cannot restrain.

XXXI
The limits of enlightenment\nWhen to enlarge we shall succeed,\nIn course of time (the whole extent\nWill not five centuries exceed\nBy computation) it is like\nOur roads transformed the eye will strike;\nHighways all Russia will unite\nAnd form a network left and right;\nOn iron bridges we shall gaze\nWhich o'er the waters boldly leap,\nMountains we'll level and through deep\nStreams excavate subaqueous ways,\nAnd Christian folk will, I expect,\nAn inn at every stage erect.

XXXII
But now, what wretched roads one sees,\nOur bridges long neglected rot,\nAnd at the stages bugs and fleas\nOne moment's slumber suffer not.\nInns there are none. Pretentious but\nMeagre, within a draughty hut,\nA bill of fare hangs full in sight\nAnd irritates the appetite.\nMeantime a Cyclops of those parts\nBefore a fire which feebly glows\nMends with the Russian hammer's blows\nThe flimsy wares of Western marts,\nWith blessings on the ditches and\nThe ruts of his own fatherland.

XXXIII
Yet on a frosty winter day\nThe journey in a sledge doth please,\nNo senseless fashionable lay\nGlides with a more luxurious ease;\nFor our Automedons are fire\nAnd our swift troikas never tire;\nThe verst posts catch the vacant eye\nAnd like a palisade flit by.\nThe Larinas unwisely went,\nFrom apprehension of the cost,\nBy their own horses, not the post – \nSo Tania to her heart's content\nCould taste the pleasures of the road.\nSeven days and nights the travellers plod.

XXXIV
But they draw near. Before them, lo!\nWhite Moscow raises her old spires,\nWhose countless golden crosses glow\nAs with innumerable fires.\nAh! brethren, what was my delight\nWhen I yon semicircle bright\nOf churches, gardens, belfries high\nDescried before me suddenly!\nMoscow, how oft in evil days,\nCondemned to exile dire by fate,\nOn thee I used to meditate!\nMoscow! How much is in the phrase\nFor every loyal Russian breast!\nHow much is in that word expressed!

XXXV
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,\nPetrovski Palace! Gloomily\nHis recent glory he invokes.\nHere, drunk with his late victory,\nNapoleon tarried till it please\nMoscow approach on bended knees,\nTime-honoured Kremlin's keys present.\nNot so! My Moscow never went\nTo seek him out with bended head.\nNo gift she bears, no feast proclaims,\nBut lights incendiary flames\nFor the impatient chief instead.\nFrom hence engrossed in thought profound\nHe on the conflagration frowned.

XXXVI
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,\nPetrovski Palace; come, astir!\nDrive on! the city barriers hoary\nAppear; along the road of Tver\nThe coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,\nPast women, sentry-boxes, rolls,\nPast palaces and nunneries,\nLamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,\nBokharians, peasants, beds of greens,\nBoulevards, belfries, milliners,\nHuts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers\nAnd fashionable magazines,\nBalconies, lion's heads on doors,\nJackdaws on every spire – in scores.

XXXVII
The weary way still incomplete,\nAn hour passed by – another – till,\nNear Khariton's in a side street\nThe coach before a house stood still.\nAt an old aunt's they had arrived\nWho had for four long years survived\nAn invalid from lung complaint.\nA Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent\nAnd spectacles, his knitting staid\nAnd the saloon threw open wide;\nThe princess from the sofa cried\nAnd the newcomers welcome bade.\nThe two old ladies then embraced\nAnd exclamations interlaced.

XXXVIII
"Princesse, mon ange!” – "Pachette!” – \n"Aline!”\n"Who would have thought it? As of yore!\nIs it for long?” – "Ma chere cousine!”\n"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!\n'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!”\n"Tania, my eldest child, you know” – \n"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!\nIs it a dream, and can it be?\nCousin, rememb'rest Grandison?”\n"What! Grandison?” – "Yes, certainly!”\n"Oh! I remember, where is he?” – \n"Here, he resides with Simeon.\nHe called upon me Christmas Eve – \nHis son is married, just conceive!”

XXXIX
"And he – but of him presently – \nTo-morrow Tania we will show,\nWhat say you? to the family – \nAlas! abroad I cannot go.\nSee, I can hardly crawl about – \nBut you must both be quite tired out!\nLet us go seek a little rest – \nAh! I'm so weak – my throbbing breast!\nOppressive now is happiness,\nNot only sorrow – Ah! my dear,\nNow I am fit for nothing here.\nIn old age life is weariness!"\nThen weeping she sank back distressed\nAnd fits of coughing racked her chest.

XL
By the sick lady's gaiety\nAnd kindness Tania was impressed,\nBut, her own room in memory,\nThe strange apartment her oppressed:\nRepose her silken curtains fled,\nShe could not sleep in her new bed.\nThe early tinkling of the bells\nWhich of approaching labour tells\nAroused Tattiana from her bed.\nThe maiden at her casement sits\nAs daylight glimmers, darkness flits,\nBut ah! discerns nor wood nor mead – \nBeneath her lay a strange courtyard,\nA stable, kitchen, fence appeared.

XLI
To consanguineous dinners they\nConduct Tattiana constantly,\nThat grandmothers and grandsires may\nContemplate her sad reverie.\nWe Russians, friends from distant parts\nEver receive with kindly hearts\nAnd exclamations and good cheer.\n"How Tania grows! Doth it appear”\n”Long since I held thee at the font – \nSince in these arms I thee did bear – \nAnd since I pulled thee by the ear – \nAnd I to give thee cakes was wont?« – \nThen the old dames in chorus sing,\n"Oh! how our years are vanishing!”

XLII
But nothing changed in them is seen,\nAll in the good old style appears,\nOur dear old aunt, Princess Helene,\nHer cap of tulle still ever wears:\nLuceria Lvovna paint applies,\nAmy Petrovna utters lies,\nIvan Petrovitch still a gaby,\nSimeon Petrovitch just as shabby;\nPelagie Nikolavna has\nHer friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,\nHer wolf-dog and her husband tame;\nStill of his club he member was – \nAs deaf and silly doth remain,\nStill eats and drinks enough for twain.

XLIII
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.\nIn the beginning, cold and mute,\nMoscow's young Graces at her stare,\nExamine her from head to foot.\nThey deem her somewhat finical,\nOutlandish and provincial,\nA trifle pale, a trifle lean,\nBut plainer girls they oft had seen.\nObedient then to Nature's law,\nWith her they did associate,\nSqueeze tiny hands and osculate;\nHer tresses curled in fashion saw,\nAnd oft in whispers would impart\nA maiden's secrets – of the heart.

XLIV
Triumphs – their own or those of friends – \nHopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment\nTheir harmless conversation blends\nWith scandal's trivial ornament.\nThen to reward such confidence\nHer amorous experience\nWith mute appeal to ask they seem – \nBut Tania just as in a dream\nWithout participation hears,\nTheir voices nought to her impart\nAnd the lone secret of her heart,\nHer sacred hoard of joy and tears,\nShe buries deep within her breast\nNor aught confides unto the rest.

XLV
Tattiana would have gladly heard\nThe converse of the world polite,\nBut in the drawing-room all appeared\nTo find in gossip such delight,\nSpeech was so tame and colourless\nTheir slander e'en was weariness;\nIn their sterility of prattle,\nQuestions and news and tittle-tattle,\nNo sense was ever manifest\nThough by an error and unsought – \nThe languid mind could smile at nought,\nHeart would not throb albeit in jest – \nEven amusing fools we miss\nIn thee, thou world of empty bliss.

XLVI
In groups, official striplings glance\nConceitedly on Tania fair,\nAnd views amongst themselves advance\nUnfavourable unto her.\nBut one buffoon unhappy deemed\nHer the ideal which he dreamed,\nAnd leaning 'gainst the portal closed\nTo her an elegy composed.\nAlso one Viazemski, remarking\nTattiana by a poor aunt's side,\nSuccessfully to please her tried,\nAnd an old gent the poet marking\nBy Tania, smoothing his peruke,\nTo ask her name the trouble took.

XLVII
But where Melpomene doth rave\nWith lengthened howl and accent loud,\nAnd her bespangled robe doth wave\nBefore a cold indifferent crowd,\nAnd where Thalia softly dreams\nAnd heedless of approval seems,\nTerpsichore alone among\nHer sisterhood delights the young\n(So 'twas with us in former years,\nIn your young days and also mine),\nNever upon my heroine\nThe jealous dame her lorgnette veers,\nThe connoisseur his glances throws\nFrom boxes or from stalls in rows.

XLVIII
To the assembly her they bear.\nThere the confusion, pressure, heat,\nThe crash of music, candles' glare\nAnd rapid whirl of many feet,\nThe ladies' dresses airy, light,\nThe motley moving mass and bright,\nYoung ladies in a vasty curve,\nTo strike imagination serve.\n'Tis there that arrant fops display\nTheir insolence and waistcoats white\nAnd glasses unemployed all night;\nThither hussars on leave will stray\nTo clank the spur, delight the fair – \nAnd vanish like a bird in air.

XLIX
Full many a lovely star hath night\nAnd Moscow many a beauty fair:\nYet clearer shines than every light\nThe moon in the blue atmosphere.\nAnd she to whom my lyre would fain,\nYet dares not, dedicate its strain,\nShines in the female firmament\nLike a full moon magnificent.\nLo! with what pride celestial\nHer feet the earth beneath her press!\nHer heart how full of gentleness,\nHer glance how wild yet genial!\nEnough, enough, conclude thy lay – \nFor folly's dues thou hadst to pay.

L
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,\nGallop, mazurka, waltzing – see!\nA pillar by, two aunts betwixt,\nTania, observed by nobody,\nLooks upon all with absent gaze\nAnd hates the world's discordant ways.\n'Tis noisome to her there: in thought\nAgain her rural life she sought,\nThe hamlet, the poor villagers,\nThe little solitary nook\nWhere shining runs the tiny brook,\nHer garden, and those books of hers,\nAnd the lime alley's twilight dim\nWhere the first time she met with him.

LI
Thus widely meditation erred,\nForgot the world, the noisy ball,\nWhilst from her countenance ne'er stirred\nThe eyes of a grave general.\nBoth aunts looked knowing as a judge,\nEach gave Tattiana's arm a nudge\nAnd in a whisper did repeat:\n"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!”\n"The left? Why, what on earth is there?” – \n"No matter, look immediately.\nThere, in that knot of company,\nTwo dressed in uniform appear – \nAh! he has gone the other way” – \n"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?” –

LII
Let us congratulations pay\nTo our Tattiana conquering,\nAnd for a time our course delay,\nThat I forget not whom I sing.\nLet me explain that in my song\n»I celebrate a comrade young\nAnd the extent of his caprice;\nO epic Muse, my powers increase\nAnd grant success to labour long;\nHaving a trusty staff bestowed,\nGrant that I err not on the road."\nEnough! my pack is now unslung – \nTo classicism I've homage paid,\nThough late, have a beginning made.

Canto

I
In the Lyceum's noiseless shade\nAs in a garden when I grew,\nI Apuleius gladly read\nBut would not look at Cicero.\n'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,\nIn spring-time, heard the cygnet's note\nBy waters shining tranquilly,\nThat first the Muse appeared to me.\nInto the study of the boy\nThere came a sudden flash of light,\nThe Muse revealed her first delight,\nSang childhood's pastimes and its joy,\nGlory with which our history teems\nAnd the heart's agitated dreams.

II
And the world met her smilingly,\nA first success light pinions gave,\nThe old Derjavine noticed me,\nAnd blest me, sinking to the grave.\nThen my companions young with pleasure\nIn the unfettered hours of leisure\nHer utterances ever heard,\nAnd by a partial temper stirred\nAnd boiling o'er with friendly heat,\nThey first of all my brow did wreathe\nAnd an encouragement did breathe\nThat my coy Muse might sing more sweet.\nO triumphs of my guileless days,\nHow sweet a dream your memories raise!

III
Passion's wild sway I then allowed,\nHer promptings unto law did make,\nPursuits I followed of the crowd,\nMy sportive Muse I used to take\nTo many a noisy feast and fight,\nTerror of guardians of the night;\nAnd wild festivities among\nShe brought with her the gift of song.\nLike a Bacchante in her sport\nBeside the cup she sang her rhymes\nAnd the young revellers of past times\nVociferously paid her court,\nAnd I, amid the friendly crowd,\nOf my light paramour was proud.

IV
But I abandoned their array,\nAnd fled afar – she followed me.\nHow oft the kindly Muse away\nHath whiled the road's monotony,\nEntranced me by some mystic tale.\nHow oft beneath the moonbeams pale\nLike Leonora did she ride\nWith me Caucasian rocks beside!\nHow oft to the Crimean shore\nShe led me through nocturnal mist\nUnto the sounding sea to list,\nWhere Nereids murmur evermore,\nAnd where the billows hoarsely raise\nTo God eternal hymns of praise.

V
Then, the far capital forgot,\nIts splendour and its blandishments,\nIn poor Moldavia cast her lot,\nShe visited the humble tents\nOf migratory gipsy hordes – \nAnd wild among them grew her words – \nOur godlike tongue she could exchange\nFor savage speech, uncouth and strange,\nAnd ditties of the steppe she loved.\nBut suddenly all changed around!\nLo! in my garden was she found\nAnd as a country damsel roved,\nA pensive sorrow in her glance\nAnd in her hand a French romance.

VI
Now for the first time I my Muse\nLead into good society,\nHer steppe-like beauties I peruse\nWith jealous fear, anxiety.\nThrough dense aristocratic rows\nOf diplomats and warlike beaux\nAnd supercilious dames she glides,\nSits down and gazes on all sides – \nAmazed at the confusing crowd,\nVariety of speech and vests,\nDeliberate approach of guests\nWho to the youthful hostess bowed,\nAnd the dark fringe of men, like frames\nEnclosing pictures of fair dames.

VII
Assemblies oligarchical\nPlease her by their decorum fixed,\nThe rigour of cold pride and all\nTitles and ages intermixed.\nBut who in that choice company\nWith clouded brow stands silently?\nUnknown to all he doth appear,\nA vision desolate and drear\nDoth seem to him the festal scene.\nDoth his brow wretchedness declare\nOr suffering pride? Why is he there?\nWho may he be? Is it Eugene?\nPray is it he? It is the same.\n"And is it long since back he came?

VIII
"Is he the same or grown more wise?\nStill doth the misanthrope appear?\nHe has returned, say in what guise?\nWhat is his latest character?\nWhat doth he act? Is it Melmoth,\nPhilanthropist or patriot,\nChilde Harold, quaker, devotee,\nOr other mask donned playfully?\nOr a good fellow for the nonce,\nLike you and me and all the rest? – \nBut this is my advice, 'twere best\nNot to behave as he did once – \nSociety he duped enow.”\n"Is he known to you?” – "Yes and No.”

IX
Wherefore regarding him express\nPerverse, unfavourable views?\nIs it that human restlessness\nFor ever carps, condemns, pursues?\nIs it that ardent souls of flame\nBy recklessness amuse or shame\nSelfish nonentities around?\nThat mind which yearns for space is bound?\nAnd that too often we receive\nProfessions eagerly for deeds,\nThat crass stupidity misleads,\nThat we by cant ourselves deceive,\nThat mediocrity alone\nWithout disgust we look upon?

X
Happy he who in youth was young,\nHappy who timely grew mature,\nHe who life's frosts which early wrung\nHath gradually learnt to endure;\nBy visions who was ne'er deranged\nNor from the mob polite estranged,\nAt twenty who was prig or swell,\nAt thirty who was married well,\nAt fifty who relief obtained\nFrom public and from private ties,\nWho glory, wealth and dignities\nHath tranquilly in turn attained,\nAnd unto whom we all allude\nAs to a worthy man and good!

XI
But sad is the reflection made,\nIn vain was youth by us received,\nThat we her constantly betrayed\nAnd she at last hath us deceived;\nThat our desires which noblest seemed,\nThe purest of the dreams we dreamed,\nHave one by one all withered grown\nLike rotten leaves by Autumn strown – \n'Tis fearful to anticipate\nNought but of dinners a long row,\nTo look on life as on a show,\nEternally to imitate\nThe seemly crowd, partaking nought\nIts passions and its modes of thought.

XII
The butt of scandal having been,\n'Tis dreadful – ye agree, I hope – \nTo pass with reasonable men\nFor a fictitious misanthrope,\nA visionary mortified,\nOr monster of Satanic pride,\nOr e'en the "Demon” of my strain.\nOnegin – take him up again – \nIn duel having killed his friend\nAnd reached, with nought his mind to engage,\nThe twenty-sixth year of his age,\nWearied of leisure in the end,\nWithout profession, business, wife,\nHe knew not how to spend his life.

XIII
Him a disquietude did seize,\nA wish from place to place to roam,\nA very troublesome disease,\nIn some a willing martyrdom.\nAbandoned he his country seat,\nOf woods and fields the calm retreat,\nWhere every day before his eyes\nA blood-bespattered shade would rise,\nAnd aimless journeys did commence – \nBut still remembrance to him clings,\nHis travels like all other things\nInspired but weariness intense;\nReturning, from his ship amid\nA ball he fell as Tchatzki did.

XIV
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,\nA whisper runs along the hall,\nA lady draws the hostess near,\nBehind her a grave general.\nHer manners were deliberate,\nReserved, but not inanimate,\nHer eyes no saucy glance address,\nThere was no angling for success.\nHer features no grimaces bleared;\nOf affectation innocent,\nCalm and without embarrassment,\nA faithful model she appeared\nOf "comme il faut.” Shishkoff, forgive!\nI can't translate the adjective.

XV
Ladies in crowds around her close,\nHer with a smile old women greet,\nThe men salute with lower bows\nAnd watch her eye's full glance to meet.\nMaidens before her meekly move\nAlong the hall, and high above\nThe crowd doth head and shoulders rise\nThe general who accompanies.\nNone could her beautiful declare,\nYet viewing her from head to foot,\nNone could a trace of that impute,\nWhich in the elevated sphere\nOf London life is "vulgar” called\nAnd ruthless fashion hath blackballed.

XVI
I like this word exceedingly\nAlthough it will not bear translation,\nWith us 'tis quite a novelty\nNot high in general estimation;\n'Twould serve ye in an epigram – \nBut turn we once more to our dame.\nEnchanting, but unwittingly,\nAt table she was sitting by\nThe brilliant Nina Voronskoi,\nThe Neva's Cleopatra, and\nNone the conviction could withstand\nThat Nina's marble symmetry,\nThough dazzling its effulgence white,\nCould not eclipse her neighbour's light.

XVII
"And is it,” meditates Eugene.\n"And is it she? It must be – no – \nHow! from the waste of steppes unseen,” – \nAnd the eternal lorgnette through\nFrequent and rapid doth his glance\nSeek the forgotten countenance\nFamiliar to him long ago.\n"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know\nThe lady in the crimson cap\nWho with the Spanish envoy speaks?” – \nThe prince's eye Onegin seeks:\n"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!\nBut stop! I will present thee, if\nYou choose.” – "But who is she?” – "My wife."

XVIII
”So thou art wed! I did not know.\nLong ago?” – "'Tis the second year.«\n"To – ?” – "Larina.” – "Tattiana?” – "So.\nAnd dost thou know her?” – "We live near.”\n"Then come with me.” The prince proceeds,\nHis wife approaches, with him leads\nHis relative and friend as well.\nThe lady's glance upon him fell – \nAnd though her soul might be confused,\nAnd vehemently though amazed\nShe on the apparition gazed,\nNo signs of trouble her accused,\nA mien unaltered she preserved,\nHer bow was easy, unreserved.

XIX
Ah no! no faintness her attacked\nNor sudden turned she red or white,\nHer brow she did not e'en contract\nNor yet her lip compressed did bite.\nThough he surveyed her at his ease,\nNot the least trace Onegin sees\nOf the Tattiana of times fled.\nHe conversation would have led – \nBut could not. Then she questioned him: – \n"Had he been long here, and where from?\nStraight from their province had he come?” – \nCast upwards then her eyeballs dim\nUnto her husband, went away – \nTransfixed Onegin mine doth stay.

XX
Is this the same Tattiana, say,\nBefore whom once in solitude,\nIn the beginning of this lay,\nDeep in the distant province rude,\nImpelled by zeal for moral worth,\nHe salutary rules poured forth?\nThe maid whose note he still possessed\nWherein the heart its vows expressed,\nWhere all upon the surface lies, – \nThat girl – but he must dreaming be – \nThat girl whom once on a time he\nCould in a humble sphere despise,\nCan she have been a moment gone\nThus haughty, careless in her tone?

XXI
He quits the fashionable throng\nAnd meditative homeward goes,\nVisions, now sad, now grateful, long\nDo agitate his late repose.\nHe wakes – they with a letter come – \nThe Princess N. will be at home\nOn such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!\nOh! I accept. And instantly\nHe a polite reply doth scrawl.\nWhat hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?\nIn the recesses what hath stirred\nOf a heart cold and cynical?\nVexation? Vanity? or strove\nAgain the plague of boyhood – love?

XXII
The hours once more Onegin counts,\nImpatient waits the close of day,\nBut ten strikes and his sledge he mounts\nAnd gallops to her house away.\nTrembling he seeks the young princess – \nTattiana finds in loneliness.\nTogether moments one or two\nThey sat, but conversation's flow\nDeserted Eugene. He, distraught,\nSits by her gloomily, desponds,\nScarce to her questions he responds,\nFull of exasperating thought.\nHe fixedly upon her stares – \nShe calm and unconcerned appears.

XXIII
The husband comes and interferes\nWith this unpleasant tete-a-tete,\nWith Eugene pranks of former years\nAnd jests doth recapitulate.\nThey talked and laughed. The guests arrived.\nThe conversation was revived\nBy the coarse wit of worldly hate;\nBut round the hostess scintillate\nLight sallies without coxcombry,\nAwhile sound conversation seems\nTo banish far unworthy themes\nAnd platitudes and pedantry,\nAnd never was the ear affright\nBy liberties or loose or light.

XXIV
And yet the city's flower was there,\nNoblesse and models of the mode,\nFaces which we meet everywhere\nAnd necessary fools allowed.\nBehold the dames who once were fine\nWith roses, caps and looks malign;\nSome marriageable maids behold,\nBlank, unapproachable and cold.\nLo, the ambassador who speaks\nEconomy political,\nAnd with gray hair ambrosial\nThe old man who has had his freaks,\nRenowned for his acumen, wit,\nBut now ridiculous a bit.

XXV
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age\nFor baseness of the spirit scorns,\nSaint Priest, who every album's page\nWith blunted pencil-point adorns.\nAnother tribune of the ball\nHung like a print against the wall,\nPink as Palm Sunday cherubim,\nMotionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.\nThe traveller, bird of passage he,\nStiff, overstarched and insolent,\nAwakens secret merriment\nBy his embarrassed dignity – \nMute glances interchanged aside\nMeet punishment for him provide.

XXVI
But my Onegin the whole eve\nWithin his mind Tattiana bore,\nNot the young timid maid, believe,\nEnamoured, simple-minded, poor,\nBut the indifferent princess,\nDivinity without access\nOf the imperial Neva's shore.\nO Men, how very like ye are\nTo Eve the universal mother,\nPossession hath no power to please,\nThe serpent to unlawful trees\nAye bids ye in some way or other – \nUnless forbidden fruit we eat,\nOur paradise is no more sweet.

XXVII
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,\nHow thoroughly her part she took!\nHow soon to habits she conformed\nWhich crushing dignity must brook!\nWho would the maiden innocent\nIn the unmoved, magnificent\nAutocrat of the drawing-room seek?\nAnd he had made her heart beat quick!\n'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,\nWhilst Morpheus his approach delays,\nShe mourned and to the moon would raise\nThe languid eye of love-sick maids,\nDreaming perchance in weal or woe\nTo end with him her path below.

XXVIII
To Love all ages lowly bend,\nBut the young unpolluted heart\nHis gusts should fertilize, amend,\nAs vernal storms the fields athwart.\nYouth freshens beneath Passion's showers,\nDevelops and matures its powers,\nAnd thus in season the rich field\nGay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.\nBut at a later, sterile age,\nThe solstice of our earthly years,\nMournful Love's deadly trace appears\nAs storms which in chill autumn rage\nAnd leave a marsh the fertile ground\nAnd devastate the woods around.

XXIX
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!\nTattiana loved as when a lad,\nBoth day and night he now must pass\nIn love-lorn meditation sad.\nCareless of every social rule,\nThe crystals of her vestibule\nHe daily in his drives drew near\nAnd like a shadow haunted her.\nEnraptured was he if allowed\nTo swathe her shoulders in the furs,\nIf his hot hand encountered hers,\nOr he dispersed the motley crowd\nOf lackeys in her pathway grouped,\nOr to pick up her kerchief stooped.

XXX
She seemed of him oblivious,\nDespite the anguish of his breast,\nReceived him freely at her house,\nAt times three words to him addressed\nIn company, or simply bowed,\nOr recognized not in the crowd.\nNo coquetry was there, I vouch – \nSociety endures not such!\nOnegin's cheek grew ashy pale,\nEither she saw not or ignored;\nOnegin wasted; on my word,\nAlready he grew phthisical.\nAll to the doctors Eugene send,\nAnd they the waters recommend.

XXXI
He went not – sooner was prepared\nTo write his forefathers to warn\nOf his approach; but nothing cared\nTattiana – thus the sex is born. – \nHe obstinately will remain,\nStill hopes, endeavours, though in vain.\nSickness more courage doth command\nThan health, so with a trembling hand\nA love epistle he doth scrawl.\nThough correspondence as a rule\nHe used to hate – and was no fool – \nYet suffering emotional\nHad rendered him an invalid;\nBut word for word his letter read.
\n*Onegin's Letter to Tattiana*\nAll is foreseen. My secret drear\nWill sound an insult in your ear.\nWhat acrimonious scorn I trace\nDepicted on your haughty face!\nWhat do I ask? What cause assigned\nThat I to you reveal my mind?\nTo what malicious merriment,\nIt may be, I yield nutriment!\nMeeting you in times past by chance,\nWarmth I imagined in your glance,\nBut, knowing not the actual truth,\nRestrained the impulses of youth;\nAlso my wretched liberty\nI would not part with finally;\nThis separated us as well – \nLenski, unhappy victim, fell,\nFrom everything the heart held dear\nI then resolved my heart to tear;\nUnknown to all, without a tie,\nI thought – retirement, liberty,\nWill happiness replace. My God!\nHow I have erred and felt the rod!\nNo, ever to behold your face,\nTo follow you in every place,\nYour smiling lips, your beaming eyes,\nTo watch with lovers' ecstasies,\nLong listen, comprehend the whole\nOf your perfections in my soul,\nBefore you agonized to die – \nThis, this were true felicity!\nBut such is not for me. I brood\nDaily of love in solitude.\nMy days of life approach their end,\nYet I in idleness expend\nThe remnant destiny concedes,\nAnd thus each stubbornly proceeds.\nI feel, allotted is my span;\nBut, that life longer may remain,\nAt morn I must assuredly\nKnow that thy face that day I see.\nI tremble lest my humble prayer\nYou with stern countenance declare\nThe artifice of villany – \nI hear your harsh, reproachful cry.\nIf ye but knew how dreadful 'tis\nTo bear love's parching agonies – \nTo burn, yet reason keep awake\nThe fever of the blood to slake – \nA passionate desire to bend\nAnd, sobbing at your feet, to blend\nEntreaties, woes and prayers, confess\nAll that the heart would fain express – \nYet with a feigned frigidity\nTo arm the tongue and e'en the eye,\nTo be in conversation clear\nAnd happy unto you appear.\nSo be it! But internal strife\nI cannot longer wage concealed.\nThe die is cast! Thine is my life!\nInto thy hands my fate I yield!

XXXII
No answer! He another sent.\nEpistle second, note the third,\nRemained unnoticed. Once he went\nTo an assembly – she appeared\nJust as he entered. How severe!\nShe will not see, she will not hear.\nAlas! she is as hard, behold,\nAnd frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.\nOh, how her lips compressed restrain\nThe indignation of her heart!\nA sidelong look doth Eugene dart:\nWhere, where, remorse, compassion, pain?\nWhere, where, the trace of tears? None, none!\nUpon her brow sits wrath alone –

XXXIII
And it may be a secret dread\nLest the world or her lord divine\nA certain little escapade\nWell known unto Onegin mine.\n'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee\nCursing his own stupidity,\nAnd brooding o'er the ills he bore,\nSociety renounced once more.\nThen in the silent cabinet\nHe in imagination saw\nThe time when Melancholy's claw\n'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,\nCaught him and by the collar took\nAnd shut him in a lonely nook.

XXXIV
He read as vainly as before,\nperusing Gibbon and Rousseau,\nManzoni, Herder and Chamfort,\nMadame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:\nHe read the unbelieving Bayle,\nAlso the works of Fontenelle,\nSome Russian authors he perused – \nNought in the universe refused:\nNor almanacs nor newspapers,\nWhich lessons unto us repeat,\nWherein I castigation get;\nAnd where a madrigal occurs\nWrit in my honour now and then – \nE sempre bene, gentlemen!

XXXV
But what results? His eyes peruse\nBut thoughts meander far away – \nIdeas, desires and woes confuse\nHis intellect in close array.\nHis eyes, the printed lines betwixt,\nOn lines invisible are fixt;\n'Twas these he read and these alone\nHis spirit was intent upon.\nThey were the wonderful traditions\nOf kindly, dim antiquity,\nDreams with no continuity,\nProphecies, threats and apparitions,\nThe lively trash of stories long\nOr letters of a maiden young.

XXXVI
And by degrees upon him grew\nA lethargy of sense, a trance,\nAnd soon imagination threw\nBefore him her wild game of chance.\nAnd now upon the snow in thaw\nA young man motionless he saw,\nAs one who bivouacs afield,\nAnd heard a voice cry – Why! He's killed! – \nAnd now he views forgotten foes,\nPoltroons and men of slanderous tongue,\nBevies of treacherous maidens young;\nOf thankless friends the circle rose,\nA mansion – by the window, see!\nShe sits alone – 'tis ever she!

XXXVII
So frequently his mind would stray\nHe well-nigh lost the use of sense,\nAlmost became a poet say – \nOh! what had been his eminence!\nIndeed, by force of magnetism\nA Russian poem's mechanism\nMy scholar without aptitude\nAt this time almost understood.\nHow like a poet was my chum\nWhen, sitting by his fire alone\nWhilst cheerily the embers shone,\nHe "Benedetta” used to hum,\nOr "Idol mio,” and in the grate\nWould lose his slippers or gazette.

XXXVIII
Time flies! a genial air abroad,\nWinter resigned her empire white,\nOnegin ne'er as poet showed\nNor died nor lost his senses quite.\nSpring cheered him up, and he resigned\nHis chambers close wherein confined\nHe marmot-like did hibernate,\nHis double sashes and his grate,\nAnd sallied forth one brilliant morn – \nAlong the Neva's bank he sleighs,\nOn the blue blocks of ice the rays\nOf the sun glisten; muddy, worn,\nThe snow upon the streets doth melt – \nWhither along them doth he pelt?

XXXIX
Onegin whither gallops? Ye\nHave guessed already. Yes, quite so!\nUnto his own Tattiana he,\nIncorrigible rogue, doth go.\nHer house he enters, ghastly white,\nThe vestibule finds empty quite – \nHe enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!\nA door he opens. But why shrank\nHe back as from a sudden blow? – \nAlone the princess sitteth there,\nPallid and with dishevelled hair,\nGazing upon a note below.\nHer tears flow plentifully and\nHer cheek reclines upon her hand.

XL
Oh! who her speechless agonies\nCould not in that brief moment guess!\nWho now could fail to recognize\nTattiana in the young princess!\nTortured by pangs of wild regret,\nEugene fell prostrate at her feet – \nShe starts, nor doth a word express,\nBut gazes on Onegin's face\nWithout amaze or wrath displayed:\nHis sunken eye and aspect faint,\nImploring looks and mute complaint\nShe comprehends. The simple maid\nBy fond illusions once possest\nIs once again made manifest.

XLI
His kneeling posture he retains – \nCalmly her eyes encounter his – \nInsensible her hand remains\nBeneath his lips' devouring kiss.\nWhat visions then her fancy thronged – \nA breathless silence then, prolonged – \nBut finally she softly said:\n»Enough, arise! for much we need\nWithout disguise ourselves explain.\nOnegin, hast forgotten yet\nThe hour when – Fate so willed – we met\nIn the lone garden and the lane?\nHow meekly then I heard you preach – \nTo-day it is my turn to teach.

XLII
"Onegin, I was younger then,\nAnd better, if I judge aright;\nI loved you – what did I obtain?\nAffection how did you requite?\nBut with austerity! – for you\nNo novelty – is it not true? – \nWas the meek love a maiden feels.\nBut now – my very blood congeals,\nCalling to mind your icy look\nAnd sermon – but in that dread hour\nI blame not your behaviour – \nAn honourable course ye took,\nDisplayed a noble rectitude – \nMy soul is filled with gratitude!

XLIII
”Then, in the country, is't not true?\nAnd far removed from rumour vain;\nI did not please you. Why pursue\nMe now, inflict upon me pain? – \nWherefore am I your quarry held? – \nIs it that I am now compelled\nTo move in fashionable life,\nThat I am rich, a prince's wife? – \nBecause my lord, in battles maimed,\nIs petted by the Emperor? – \nThat my dishonour would ensure\nA notoriety proclaimed,\nAnd in society might shed\nA bastard fame prohibited?

XLIV
"I weep. And if within your breast\nMy image hath not disappeared,\nKnow that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,\nYour conversation cold and hard,\nIf the choice in my power were,\nTo lawless love I should prefer – \nAnd to these letters and these tears.\nFor visions of my childish years\nThen ye were barely generous,\nAge immature averse to cheat – \nBut now – what brings you to my feet? – \nHow mean, how pusillanimous!\nA prudent man like you and brave\nTo shallow sentiment a slave!

XLV
”Onegin, all this sumptuousness,\nThe gilding of life's vanities,\nIn the world's vortex my success,\nMy splendid house and gaieties – \nWhat are they? Gladly would I yield\nThis life in masquerade concealed,\nThis glitter, riot, emptiness,\nFor my wild garden and bookcase, – \nYes! for our unpretending home,\nOnegin – the beloved place\nWhere the first time I saw your face, – \nOr for the solitary tomb\nWherein my poor old nurse doth lie\nBeneath a cross and shrubbery.

XLVI
"'Twas possible then, happiness – \nNay, near – but destiny decreed – \nMy lot is fixed – with thoughtlessness\nIt may be that I did proceed – \nWith bitter tears my mother prayed,\nAnd for Tattiana, mournful maid,\nIndifferent was her future fate.\nI married – now, I supplicate – \nFor ever your Tattiana leave.\nYour heart possesses, I know well,\nHonour and pride inflexible.\nI love you – to what end deceive? – \nBut I am now another's bride – \nFor ever faithful will abide.”

XLVII
She rose – departed. But Eugene\nStood as if struck by lightning fire.\nWhat a storm of emotions keen\nRaged round him and of balked desire!\nAnd hark! the clank of spurs is heard\nAnd Tania's husband soon appeared. – \nBut now our hero we must leave\nJust at a moment which I grieve\nMust be pronounced unfortunate – \nFor long – for ever. To be sure\nTogether we have wandered o'er\nThe world enough. Congratulate\nEach other as the shore we climb!\nHurrah! it long ago was time!

XLVIII
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,\nFoeman or friend, I do aspire\nTo part in amity with thee!\nAdieu! whate'er thou didst desire\nFrom careless stanzas such as these,\nOf passion reminiscences,\nPictures of the amusing scene,\nRepose from labour, satire keen,\nOr faults of grammar on its page – \nGod grant that all who herein glance,\nIn serious mood or dalliance\nOr in a squabble to engage,\nMay find a crumb to satisfy.\nNow we must separate. Good-bye!

XLIX
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,\nThou also, my ideal true,\nAnd thou, persistent to the end,\nMy little book. With thee I knew\nAll that a poet could desire,\nOblivion of life's tempest dire,\nOf friends the grateful intercourse – \nOh, many a year hath run its course\nSince I beheld Eugene and young\nTattiana in a misty dream,\nAnd my romance's open theme\nGlittered in a perspective long,\nAnd I discerned through Fancy's prism\nDistinctly not its mechanism.

But ye to whom, when friendship heard,\nThe first-fruits of my tale I read,\nAs Saadi anciently averred –\nSome are afar and some are dead.\nWithout them Eugene is complete;\nAnd thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;\nWas drawn, ideal of my lay – \nAh! what hath fate not torn away!\nHappy who quit life's banquet seat\nBefore the dregs they shall divine\nOf the cup brimming o'er with wine – \nWho the romance do not complete,\nBut who abandon it – as I\nHave my Onegin – suddenly.
